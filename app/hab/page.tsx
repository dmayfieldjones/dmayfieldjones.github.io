            <p className="intro-text">
              From 2015-2017, HAB.education was a grassroots STEAM education initiative that 
              brought together friends, educators, and researchers to create engaging, hands-on 
              learning experiences using high altitude balloon experiments. What started as a 
              collaborative project with friends became a thriving community that bridged the 
              gap between traditional education and real-world applications.
            </p>
            <p className="intro-text">
              As co-founder and organizer, I helped facilitate connections with researchers at 
              NASA Goddard, collaborated with student groups like Stanford Space Initiative, and 
              built a community that shared knowledge and resources. Together, we created 
              educational tools and methodologies that made atmospheric science accessible to 
              students and educators everywhere.
