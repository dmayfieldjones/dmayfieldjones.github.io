                The brick house was built by James Michael and Mahalia Ann West.
                It was started in 1893 and finished in 1895. James Michael West
                farmed something in excess of 240 acres. In addition he operated
                a sawmill [built in the 1830s by George Akers, remains of the
                mill were on the property owned by James Michael West after
                1854] and a brickyard. James Michael's sawmill produced the wood
                used in the house. His brickyard made the bricks. He took a
                wagon load of lumber to Decatur to be dried and milled for the
                trim work. The parlor fireplace millwork is quarter sawn
                Sycamore. Oak and Pine trim the other rooms.

                The home is all brick construction; both load bearing interior
                and exterior walls are multiple courses of brick, not brick
                veneer as is common today. When the house was first finished in
                1895 it had central heat, a water system, an indoor bathroom
                complete with tub and commode and gas lights. When the original
                single pane windows were replaced with insulated double pane
                windows, the stained glass windows that were original to the
                house were reinstalled in front of the replacement windows.

                James Michael and Mahalia Ann West, my great grandparents, lived
                in the home until their death, at which time it passed to my
                grandparents James Harvey ("Harv") and Ruby West. They lived in
                the house until James Harvey's death. Ruby West continued to
                live in the house, until she could no longer care for it and
                moved in with her daughter, my mother, Mary Clark. The house was
                then occupied by one of Ruby's grandchildren until her death, at
                which time the house passed to her daughter, Mary Clark. At this
                time, Theresa Rogers, Mary's granddaughter, my daughter, and her
                family occupied the home. The home became my property after my
                mother's death and I passed it on to Theresa. Theresa and her
                family lived in the home until her death.
