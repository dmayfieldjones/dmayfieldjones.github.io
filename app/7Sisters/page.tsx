          <p>
            One reason we love dogs is because they tell us something profound
            about ourselves. Dogs are by far the oldest and most widespread
            species domesticated by humans. Darwin used dogs, among pigeons and
            Brassicas, to bridge the gap between artificial selection and
            natural selection in his 1859 publication
            <cite>The Origin of Species</cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early scientists focused more on artificial selection of livestock
            and crops, but it was in fact our beloved dog companions that were
            <a href="/posts/2025-10-01-the-deep-history-of-dogs-ancient-dna" style={{ 
              color: '#bf141c', 
              textDecoration: 'underline',
              fontWeight: 'bold'
            }}>domesticated millennia before any other known species</a>. Unlike these
            others, dogs reside in our homes and live up to the name
            domesticate, coming from the Latin domicile, meaning home. Also,
            unlike other domesticates, dogs chose us. The bond between dogs and
            humans is unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both highly social group hunters, humans and dogs likely began to
            co-evolve as hunting partners. While there are no anatomical markers
            to differentiate dogs from wolves, dogs' definitive trait is
            behavioral: loyalty. Wolves and dogs descended from a wolf-like
            common ancestor 20,000-40,000 years ago. The earliest archaeological
            evidence suggests dogs had a special place in our hearts by ~14,000
            years ago when a Nautifian woman was buried alongside a dog. Our
            relationship is ancient and deep.
