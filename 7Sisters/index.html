  Family<br>
  <br>
  Our Great Danes are family members. They are sacred. They are also not for everyone. Great Danes are a large breed of dog that we do not recommend for most first time dog owners. They eat more, have greater veterinary needs than smaller breeds, and while they don’t require a lot of living space, need a large outdoor area to simply manage waste. As puppies, they can cause a lot of damage in the home and require a good deal of supervision. However, Great Danes are the ultimate family companion animal. They do not live long relative to other dogs, and the breed can break your heart. Choosing a breeder you can trust is critical. 
  <br>
  With a 7Sisters Great Dane in your family, you are invited to be part of ours. We expect to hear from you long after you bring your dog home. We love updates and look forward to seeing our family grow: birthdays, anniversaries, achievements, and losses. We hope you consider a Spekter Great Dane as your family member. You can apply as a candidate family member by requesting our Inquiry, Evaluation, and Puppy Proposal worksheets. Living with your new family member helps continue a line of Great Danes that can be traced over 35 generations to the 1870s. Thank you for your interest in preserving our breed.

  History <br>
  <br>
  Dogs are by far the oldest and most widespread species domesticated by humans. Darwin used dogs, among others such as pigeons and Brassicas, to bridge the gap between artificial selection and natural selection in his 1859 publication The Origin of Species. Early scientists focused more on artificial selection of livestock and crops, but it was in fact our beloved dog companions that were domesticated millenia before any other known species. Unlike these others, dogs reside in our homes and live up to the name domesticate, coming from the Latin domicile, meaning home. Also, unlike other domesticates, dogs chose us. The bond between dogs and humans is unique. 
  <br>   
Both highly social group hunters, humans and dogs likely began to co-evolve as highly social group hunters. There are no anatomical markers to differentiate dogs from wolves. Dogs' definitive trait is loyalty. Wolves and dogs descended from a wolf-like common ancestor 20,000-40,000 years ago. The earliest archaeological evidence suggests dogs had a special place in our hearts by ~14,000 years ago when a Nautifian woman was buried alongside a dog.
