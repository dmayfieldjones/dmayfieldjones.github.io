  Our Great Danes are family members. They are sacred. Great Danes are not for everyone. <!---Great Danes are a large breed of dog that we do not recommend for most first time dog owners. They eat more, have greater veterinary needs than smaller breeds, and while they donâ€™t require a lot of living space, need a large outdoor area to simply manage waste. As puppies, they can cause a lot of damage in the home and require a good deal of supervision. However, Great Danes are the ultimate family companion animal. They do not live long relative to other dogs, and the breed can break your heart. --->Choosing a breeder you can trust is critical.

  <FONT COLOR="#bf141c">Our Ancient Bond</FONT><br>
  <br>
  One reason we love dogs is because they tell us something profound about ourselves. Dogs are by far the oldest and most widespread species domesticated by humans. Darwin used dogs, among pigeons and Brassicas, to bridge the gap between artificial selection and natural selection in his 1859 publication <i>The Origin of Species</i>. Early scientists focused more on artificial selection of livestock and crops, but it was in fact our beloved dog companions that were domesticated millenia before any other known species. Unlike these others, dogs reside in our homes and live up to the name domesticate, coming from the Latin domicile, meaning home. Also, unlike other domesticates, dogs chose us. The bond between dogs and humans is unique. 
  <br><br>   
Both highly social group hunters, humans and dogs likely began to co-evolve as hunting partners. While there are no anatomical markers to differentiate dogs from wolves, dogs' definitive trait is behavioral: loyalty. Wolves and dogs descended from a wolf-like common ancestor 20,000-40,000 years ago. The earliest archaeological evidence suggests dogs had a special place in our hearts by ~14,000 years ago when a Nautifian woman was buried alongside a dog. Our relationship is ancient and deep.
