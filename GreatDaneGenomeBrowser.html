Variations create different white spotting patterns, from small white chest spots to mostly white dogs with colored patches. In extreme cases, it can affect eye color and hearing. In Great Danes, this gene may contribute to white markings like chest spots or white paws. White spots on dogs don't come from just one change in a single gene called MITF. Instead, the different patterns of white spots we see in dogs (like Extreme White, Piebald, and Irish Spotting) happen because of different combinations of gene changes. Research shows that two specific changes in the MITF gene (called LP and SINE insertions) work together to reduce the amount of MITF protein made while the puppy is developing before birth. When less MITF protein is made, the dog ends up with more white areas in its coat. Scientists still need to figure out if these white spot patterns are only caused by different combinations of MITF gene changes, or if other genes that affect how color cells develop and move around in the developing puppy are also involved."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:{\"P\":null,\"b\":\"XLv-4zXLorsqMIwkbFK5a\",\"p\":\"\",\"c\":[\"\",\"GreatDaneGenomeBrowser\"],\"i\":false,\"f\":[[[\"\",{\"children\":[\"GreatDaneGenomeBrowser\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],[\"\",[\"$\",\"$1\",\"c\",{\"children\":[[[\"$\",\"link\",\"0\",{\"rel\":\"stylesheet\",\"href\":\"/_next/static/css/249dc0db5cc78d92.css\",\"precedence\":\"next\",\"crossOrigin\":\"$undefined\",\"nonce\":\"$undefined\"}]],[\"$\",\"$L2\",null,{\"Component\":\"$3\",\"slots\":{\"children\":[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"parallelRouterKey\":\"children\",\"segmentPath\":[\"children\"],\"error\":\"$undefined\",\"errorStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"errorScripts\":\"$undefined\",\"template\":[\"$\",\"$L5\",null,{}],\"templateStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"templateScripts\":\"$undefined\",\"notFound\":[[],[[\"$\",\"title\",null,{\"children\":\"404: This page could not be found.\"}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"style\":{\"fontFamily\":\"system-ui,\\\"Segoe UI\\\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\\\"Apple Color Emoji\\\",\\\"Segoe UI Emoji\\\"\",\"height\":\"100vh\",\"textAlign\":\"center\",\"display\":\"flex\",\"flexDirection\":\"column\",\"alignItems\":\"center\",\"justifyContent\":\"center\"},\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"style\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}\"}}],[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"next-error-h1\",\"style\":{\"display\":\"inline-block\",\"margin\":\"0 20px 0 0\",\"padding\":\"0 23px 0 0\",\"fontSize\":24,\"fontWeight\":500,\"verticalAlign\":\"top\",\"lineHeight\":\"49px\"},\"children\":404}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"style\":{\"display\":\"inline-block\"},\"children\":[\"$\",\"h2\",null,{\"style\":{\"fontSize\":14,\"fontWeight\":400,\"lineHeight\":\"49px\",\"margin\":0},\"children\":\"This page could not be found.\"}]}]]}]}]]],\"forbidden\":\"$undefined\",\"unauthorized\":\"$undefined\"}]},\"params\":{},\"promise\":\"$@6\"}]]}],{\"children\":[\"GreatDaneGenomeBrowser\",[\"$\",\"$1\",\"c\",{\"children\":[null,[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"parallelRouterKey\":\"children\",\"segmentPath\":[\"children\",\"GreatDaneGenomeBrowser\",\"children\"],\"error\":\"$undefined\",\"errorStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"errorScripts\":\"$undefined\",\"template\":[\"$\",\"$L5\",null,{}],\"templateStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"templateScripts\":\"$undefined\",\"notFound\":\"$undefined\",\"forbidden\":\"$undefined\",\"unauthorized\":\"$undefined\"}]]}],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",[\"$\",\"$1\",\"c\",{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L7\",null,{\"geneCategories\":[{\"type\":\"coatcolor\",\"name\":\"A Locus Agouti Signaling Protein (ASIP)\",\"name2\":\"ASIP\",\"summary\":\"This gene controls which pigment gets produced in each hair - either red/yellow or black/brown.

Research on this gene has improved our understanding of the neurochemical basis of behavior.\",\"location\":\"chr18:46782129-46789967\"},{\"type\":\"behavioral\",\"name\":\"SLC1A2\",\"name2\":\"SLC1A2\",\"summary\":\"This gene produces a transporter that removes the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from synapses, preventing excessive stimulation. Variations are associated with differences in cognitive abilities, stress resistance, and potentially certain neurological and behavioral disorders in dogs. Proper glutamate clearance is critical for normal brain function. Research on this gene has provided insights into the genetic basis of cognitive and behavioral traits in dogs.\",\"location\":\"chr18:32967648-33106043\"},{\"type\":\"hypersocial\",\"name\":\"General transcription factor II-I (GTF2I)\",\"name2\":\"GTF2I\",\"summary\":\"This gene plays a role in how dogs interact socially, particularly with humans. Variations are linked to the hypersocial behavior that distinguishes dogs from wolves - their tendency to seek human attention and interaction. Studies show domestic dogs typically have variants that contribute to their friendliness toward humans. This gene helps explain the unique bond between dogs and people and gives insight into the domestication process.\",\"location\":\"chr6:5644547-5758859\"},{\"type\":\"hypersocial\",\"name\":\"General transcription factor II-I repeat domain-containing protein 1 (GTF2IRD1)\",\"name2\":\"GTF2IRD1\",\"summary\":\"Similar to GTF2I, this gene affects social behavior in dogs. It influences how dogs interact with humans and potentially contributed to behavioral changes during domestication. The gene regulates other genes involved in brain development and function, affecting social traits that made dogs suitable companions for humans. Research on this gene helps explain the genetic basis of the human-dog bond.\",\"location\":\"chr6:5806109-5917143\"},{\"type\":\"hypersocial\",\"name\":\"Putative polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-like protein 3 (WBSCR17)\",\"name2\":\"WBSCR17\",\"summary\":\"This gene is thought to influence social behavior and cognitive abilities in dogs. While its exact function is still being studied, variations are associated with differences in social and cognitive traits across dog breeds. The gene modifies proteins that affect brain development and function. Studying this gene helps scientists understand the genetic basis of dog behavior and the cognitive abilities that developed during domestication.\"},{\"type\":\"hypersocial\",\"name\":\"Nuclear envelope pore membrane protein (POM121)\",\"name2\":\"POM121\",\"summary\":\"This gene creates proteins that form pores in the membrane surrounding a cell's nucleus, allowing molecules to move between the nucleus and the rest of the cell. While less studied than other social behavior genes, it may influence cellular processes that affect development, growth, and various body functions. Some research suggests it could play a role in cellular stress responses and longevity.\"}]}],null,[\"$\",\"$L9\",null,{\"children\":\"$La\"}]]}],{},null,false]},null,false]},null,false],[\"$\",\"$1\",\"h\",{\"children\":[null,[\"$\",\"$1\",\"7kVfYN--LORsTfnMzMXZ-\",{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$Lb\",null,{\"children\":\"$Lc\"}],[\"$\",\"$Ld\",null,{\"children\":\"$Le\"}],null]}]]}],false]],\"m\":\"$undefined\",\"G\":[\"$f\",\"$undefined\"],\"s\":false,\"S\":true}\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"6:{}\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"name\":\"viewport\",\"content\":\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"}]]\nc:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"7Sisters - Genome Browsers\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"Our mission and approach to breeding exceptional Great Danes at 7Sisters Farm\"}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"a:null\n"])</script></body></html>
