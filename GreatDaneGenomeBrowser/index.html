The gene's activity can be modified by other genes, leading to a wide range of coat color variations across different dog breeds. Mutations in the ASIP gene can result in unique coat patterns, such as the dominant black coloration seen in some breeds like German Shepherds and Shetland Sheepdogs.

Variations in the MC1R gene are responsible for different coat colors in dogs, including red, yellow, and cream. Mutations in this gene can lead to a loss of function, resulting in the production of only red/yellow pigment, as seen in Irish Setters and yellow Labrador Retrievers.

It produces a protein that can bind to the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), influencing pigment production. The dominant "black" allele of this gene (KB) causes solid black coloration in many dog breeds, overriding other color patterns. The CBD103 gene interacts with other coat color genes, particularly ASIP, to produce various color patterns.

It plays a crucial role in the transport and distribution of pigment granules within melanocytes. Mutations in the MLPH gene can lead to improper pigment distribution, resulting in a diluted or "washed-out" appearance of the coat color. This dilution effect transforms black to blue/grey, liver to isabella (lilac), and red to cream. The dilute phenotype is observed in various dog breeds, including Weimaraners, Doberman Pinschers, and some Great Danes. In some breeds, the dilute phenotype has been associated with coat problems such as color dilution alopecia, although this link is not fully understood and may involve other genetic factors.

It plays a crucial role in the formation of melanosomes, the organelles where melanin pigments are produced and stored. A specific insertion in the PMEL17 gene causes the merle phenotype, characterized by patches of diluted pigment interspersed with normal coloration. The merle pattern is seen in various dog breeds, including Australian Shepherds, Collies, and Great Danes. However, the merle mutation can have health implications when inherited in a double dose (homozygous merle), often resulting in vision and hearing problems. Due to these potential health issues, breeding two merle dogs together is generally discouraged in responsible breeding practices.",

This gene interacts with the merle gene (PMEL17) to produce the distinctive Harlequin pattern, characterized by white dogs with black patches. The Harlequin mutation in PSMB7 modifies the merle phenotype by removing the dilute patches, leaving only the full-color patches on a white background. This pattern is unique to Great Danes and is not found in other dog breeds. However, like the merle gene, the Harlequin gene can have health implications when inherited in certain combinations, particularly when two Harlequin dogs are bred together.

Mutations in the TYRP1 gene can result in the production of brown pigment instead of black, leading to coat colors often referred to as brown, chocolate, or liver depending on the breed. This gene affects both coat color and the color of the dog's nose, paw pads, and eyes. The brown color produced by TYRP1 mutations can be seen in many dog breeds, including Labrador Retrievers, German Shorthaired Pointers, and Chesapeake Bay Retrievers.

The extent of white spotting can vary widely, from the minimal white chest spot seen in some breeds to the predominantly white coats with colored head and body spots seen in others. MITF mutations can also affect eye color and hearing in some dogs, particularly in breeds with extensive white coloration.

In canines, this gene plays a crucial role in maintaining proper hemostasis by inhibiting plasmin, an enzyme that breaks down blood clots. Mutations in the SERPINF2 gene have been associated with a rare bleeding disorder in dogs called alpha-2-antiplasmin deficiency, which can lead to prolonged bleeding times and increased risk of hemorrhage. While this condition is uncommon, it has been reported in various dog breeds and can be a concern for breeders and veterinarians managing canine health. Understanding the function of SERPINF2 in dogs not only contributes to better diagnostic and treatment options for affected animals but also provides valuable insights into comparative studies of blood coagulation disorders across species, including humans.

In dogs, mutations in the SOD1 gene have been associated with degenerative myelopathy (DM), a progressive neurological disorder that affects the spinal cord. This condition is particularly prevalent in certain breeds, including German Shepherds, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, and Boxers. DM typically manifests in older dogs and leads to gradual paralysis of the hind limbs, eventually progressing to affect the front limbs. While not all dogs with SOD1 mutations will develop DM, genetic testing for these mutations can help breeders make informed decisions to reduce the incidence of the disease in susceptible breeds. Understanding the role of SOD1 in canine health has significant implications for both veterinary medicine and comparative studies of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as similar SOD1 mutations are associated with some forms of ALS in humans.",

Mutations in the BIN1 gene can lead to improper muscle fiber formation and function, resulting in affected dogs having difficulty standing, walking, and even swallowing. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that dogs must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. Genetic testing for BIN1 mutations has become an important tool for Great Dane breeders to reduce the incidence of CNM in the breed.

Mutations in MFSD12 have been associated with the production of gray or "blue" coat colors in several dog breeds, including Kerry Blue Terriers and Italian Greyhounds. The gene\'s effects are particularly noticeable in breeds where the gray color develops over time, with puppies born dark and gradually lightening as they mature. While primarily known for its role in coat color, research into MFSD12 also provides insights into the complex genetic interactions that determine canine pigmentation patterns.

This condition has been particularly noted in Labrador Retrievers, but can occur in other breeds as well. The NAPEPLD gene is involved in the metabolism of certain lipids that are important for maintaining the barrier function of the skin, including the specialized skin of the nose. Mutations in this gene can disrupt the normal balance of lipids in the nasal epithelium, leading to the characteristic symptoms of HNPK.

The PRCD gene plays a crucial role in the maintenance and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. Mutations in this gene lead to the gradual degeneration of these cells, first affecting night vision (rod cells) and later day vision (cone cells), ultimately resulting in complete blindness. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning a dog must inherit two copies of the mutated gene to develop the disease.
