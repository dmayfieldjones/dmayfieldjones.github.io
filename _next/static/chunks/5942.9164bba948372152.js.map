Like GTF2I, GTF2IRD1 is part of the region linked to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which is characterized by hypersocial behavior among other traits. In dogs, variations in GTF2IRD1 have been associated with differences in social behavior, particularly in how dogs interact with humans. This gene is thought to play a role in regulating the expression of other genes involved in neural development and function. Studies have suggested that changes in GTF2IRD1 may have contributed to the evolution of dog behavior during domestication, potentially influencing traits that made dogs more suited to living and working with humans. Research into GTF2IRD1 and related genes provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of dog-human bonding and the complex interplay between genetics and behavior in canines.',\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Putative polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-like protein 3 (WBSCR17)',\n    location: 'chr6:1,873,204-2,303,372',\n    type: 'hypersocial',\n    summary:\n      'The Putative polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-like protein 3 (WBSCR17) gene, also known as GALNT17, is another gene located in the region associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans. In dogs, this gene has been studied for its potential role in social behavior and cognitive development. While its specific function in dogs is not as well understood as GTF2I or GTF2IRD1, variations in WBSCR17 have been associated with differences in social behavior and cognitive traits across dog breeds. The gene is thought to be involved in protein modification processes that may influence neural development and function. Research into WBSCR17 and other genes in this region contributes to our understanding of the genetic basis of complex behavioral traits in dogs. Studying these genes helps shed light on the evolutionary changes that occurred during dog domestication and the genetic underpinnings of the unique cognitive and social abilities of domestic dogs.',\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Nuclear envelope pore membrane protein (POM121)',\n    location: 'chr6:6,688,239-6,715,065',\n    type: 'hypersocial',\n    summary:\n      \"The Nuclear envelope pore membrane protein (POM121) gene plays a crucial role in the formation and function of nuclear pore complexes, which are essential for the transport of molecules between the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. While POM121 is not as well-studied in dogs as some of the other genes we've discussed, it is known to be important for cellular function across many species. In the context of canine genetics, variations in POM121 could potentially influence cellular processes that affect development, growth, or various physiological functions. Some studies have suggested that genes involved in nuclear pore complex formation, including POM121, may play a role in cellular stress responses and longevity. However, more research is needed to fully understand the specific implications of POM121 variations in dogs. Studying genes like POM121 contributes to our broader understanding of canine cellular biology and may provide insights into developmental processes or potential health implications in dogs.\",\n
