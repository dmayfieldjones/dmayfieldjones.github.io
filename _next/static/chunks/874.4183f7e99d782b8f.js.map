Studying these genes helps shed light on the evolutionary changes that occurred during dog domestication and the genetic underpinnings of the unique cognitive and social abilities of domestic dogs.',\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Nuclear envelope pore membrane protein (POM121C)',\n    location: 'chr6:6,688,239-6,715,065',\n    geneName: 'POM121C',\n    type: 'hypersocial',\n    summary:\n      \"The Nuclear envelope pore membrane protein (POM121) gene plays a crucial role in the formation and function of nuclear pore complexes, which are essential for the transport of molecules between the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. While POM121 is not as well-studied in dogs as some of the other genes we've discussed, it is known to be important for cellular function across many species. In the context of canine genetics, variations in POM121 could potentially influence cellular processes that affect development, growth, or various physiological functions. Some studies have suggested that genes involved in nuclear pore complex formation, including POM121, may play a role in cellular stress responses and longevity. However, more research is needed to fully understand the specific implications of POM121 variations in dogs. Studying genes like POM121 contributes to our broader understanding of canine cellular biology and may provide insights into developmental processes or potential health implications in dogs.\",\n  },\n] as const\n","// @ts-nocheck\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\n\nimport Ideogram from 'ideogram'\n\nexport default class ReactIdeogram extends Component {\n  createIdeogram() {\n    const config = Object.assign(\n      {\n        dataDir: 'https://eweitz.github.io/ideogram/dist/data/bands/native/',\n        container: '#ideo-container',\n      },\n      this.props,\n    )\n    new Ideogram(config)\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    return this.createIdeogram()\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    return this.createIdeogram()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <div id=\"ideo-container\"></div>\n  }\n}\n","export function replaceLink(str: string) {\n  return str.replace(\n    /\\(([^,]+),\\s*(\\d{4})\\)(?:.*?)?(https?:\\/\\/[^\\s]+)/g,\n\n    function (_match, author, year, url) {\n      return `<a href=\"${url}\" target=\"_blank\">(${author}, ${year})</a>`\n    },\n  )\n}\n","'use client'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport geneCategories from './categories'\nimport ReactIdeogram from './Ideogram'\nimport { replaceLink } from './util'\n\nconst set1 = [\n  '#377eb8',\n  '#e41a1c',\n  '#4daf4a',\n  '#984ea3',\n  '#ff7f00',\n  '#ffff33',\n  '#a65628',\n  '#f781bf',\n  '#999999',\n]\n\nconst colorMap = {\n  coatcolor: set1[0],\n  hypersocial: set1[1],\n  health: set1[2],\n}\n\nfunction Ideogram({\n  type,\n  setType,\n  setGene,\n}: {\n  type: string\n  setType: (arg: string) => void\n  setGene: (arg: string) => void\n}) {\n  const annotations = geneCategories\n    .filter(f => f.type === type)\n    .map(r => {\n      const { type, location, name } = r\n      const [chr, rest] = location.split(':')\n      const [start, stop] = rest.split('-')\n      return {\n        name,\n        type,\n        chr: chr.replace('chr', ''),\n        start: +start.replaceAll(',', ''),\n        color: colorMap[type],\n        stop: +stop.replaceAll(',', ''),\n      }\n    })\n  return (\n    <div id=\"eukaryotes-example\" className=\"App\">\n      <ReactIdeogram\n        // @ts-expect-error\n        organism=\"canis-lupus-familiaris\"\n        rotatable={false}\n        chrWidth={10}\n        chrHeight={200}\n        rows={2}\n        showNonNuclearChromosomes={true}\n        annotations={annotations}\n        onClickAnnot={(arg: { name: string }) => {\n          const f = geneCategories?.find(f => f.name === arg.name)?.type\n          if (f) {\n            setType(f)\n            setGene(arg.name)\n          }\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default function () {\n  const [type, setType] = useState('')\n  const [gene, setGene] = useState('')\n\n  const categories = [...new Set<string>(geneCategories.map(f => f.type))]\n  const currentCategory = geneCategories.filter(f => f.type === type)\n  const geneEntry = currentCategory?.find(f => f.name === gene)\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"content\">\n          <main className=\"content-wrapper\">\n            {/* Hero Section */}\n            <section className=\"hero-section\">\n              <img\n                src=\"/img/Colorlogo_nobackground.png\"\n                alt=\"7Sisters Farm Logo\"\n                width={300}\n                height=\"auto\"\n                className=\"hero-logo\"\n                loading=\"lazy\"\n                style={{ margin: '0 auto' }}\n              />\n            </section>\n            <p />\n            <span className=\"accent-color\">7</span>Sisters Genome Browser\n            (CanFam4)\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Select a category of genes, then an individual gene/locus to learn\n            more about it\n            <br />\n            <div id=\"geneSelector\">\n              <select\n                value={type}\n                onChange={event => setType(event.target.value)}\n                id=\"categorySelect\"\n              >\n                <option value=\"\">Select a category</option>\n                {categories.map(category => (\n                  <option key={category} value={category}>\n                    {category}\n                  </option>\n                ))}\n              </select>\n              <select\n                value={gene}\n                onChange={event => {\n                  setGene(event.target.value)\n                }}\n                id=\"geneSelect\"\n              >\n                <option value=\"\">\n                  Select a gene {type ? `(${type} related)` : ''}\n                </option>\n                {currentCategory.map(entry => (\n                  <option key={entry.name} value={entry.name}>\n                    {entry.name}\n                  </option>\n                ))}\n              </select>\n              {geneEntry ?
