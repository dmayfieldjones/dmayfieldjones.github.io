We argue there is no feed specific to a particular breed.\n            However, Great Dane puppies should not be fed many feeds labeled for\n            puppies because they contain excessively high concentrations of\n            protein and fat. Rehydrating a quality dry kibble and supporting\n            your dog with a variety of additional healthy foods (less than 10%\n            by weight of their diet) will meet the needs of most dogs and\n            satisfy dog lovers. A fresh, or raw, diet can also provide\n            exceptional nutrition for your dog. <br /> The amount your Dane will\n            eat depends on age, sex, type of food, and level of activity.\n            Generally, our 8-12 week old puppies will eat 1.5 cups for each of\n            their 3 daily meals. Adults will eat 6-10 cups daily divided roughly\n            between two meals.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <button\n          className={`accordion ${activeIndex === 4 ? 'active' : ''}`}\n          onClick={() => toggleAccordion(4)}\n        >\n          {/* @ts-expect-error */}\n          <font color=\"#bf141c\">Why and how do you crop?</font>\n        </button>\n        <div className={`panel ${activeIndex === 4 ? 'panel-open' : ''}`}>\n          <p>\n            It is the choice of the puppy owner whether or not to crop. We\n            believe the minimally invasive surgery on, and following months of\n            maintenance for, dogs that are cropped is a benign custom that\n            appeals to aesthetic and traditional values shared by many dog\n            lovers. Ear cropping continues to be a largely aesthetic choice. We\n            find arguments in favor of cropping because of health and/or the\n            natural upright ears of undomesticated canids unconvincing. Equally\n            unconvincing are arguments discouraging cropping due to a suggested\n            reduced ability to communicate, comparisons to amputation or\n            mutilation, and veterinary professionals claiming the procedure\n            non-medically necessary or lacking a scientific justification.\n            Undeniably, cropping is legally prohibited throughout many regions\n            of the world, and the condemning and illegalization of cropping has\n            had historical impacts on the breeding and popularity of Great\n            Danes. There are no documented widespread changes in health or\n            behavior due to cropping. There is no evidence for elevated cortisol\n            levels after the wounds have healed in 7-10 days. We believe from\n            personal experience that it is no more traumatic than a pierced ear\n            or a scratched knee in which the wound similarly takes a few days to\n            heal. It may be sore and itch, and we treat these symptoms. Posting\n            the ear is not painful and much more frustrating and worrisome to\n            the human than the dog. Therefore, we strongly advocate for and\n            defend the choice of dog lovers and veterinarians to continue to\n            crop their dogs as an extension of supporting the historical\n            preservation and aesthetic of the Great Dane breed Standard and\n            larger breed concept. It is a beautiful thing. <br /> We choose and\n            endorse Dr. Anne Midgarden DVM (Ohio) to crop our Great Dane puppies\n            for our clients. We present clients with a modified care guide for\n            educational purposes only. Cropping considerations and care should\n            be made with the guidance of your veterinarian and breeders.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <button\n          className={`accordion ${activeIndex === 5 ?
