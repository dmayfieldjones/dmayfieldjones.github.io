Our mission is to make the world a better place for dogs by supporting the dog loving community and to secure Great Danes as the most desired, aspirational dog companion. 
<p></p>
We advance our mission by producing the best possible Great Danes and placing them in environments that give them the best possible chance of having wonderful lives. We assume dogs belong in homes and deserve enriched lives sharing relationships with both humans and other dogs. There is a vast discrepancy between the demand for dogs and their supply from breeders we deem ethical, and most dog owners do not know from where dogs come. We strive to combat the deep lack of understanding of honorable dog breeding by educating dog owners, shelters, and those from the animal welfare community. 
<p></p>
We believe people working to further our mission should be encouraged, celebrated, and awarded. We therefore endorse and discourage facets of dog breeding while recognizing the expression of opinions. Our relationship with dogs is complex, diverse, and subtle. Dogs mean very different things to different people. Like our choices in music or food, the relationships we form with dogs are very personal. There are many dog communities that differ in their values and perspectives, and we have a lot to learn from each other. Not all dogs are suited for all environments. No breeder can supply all the types of dogs for which people are seeking, and there is very little more important than matching people with the dog that fits them.
