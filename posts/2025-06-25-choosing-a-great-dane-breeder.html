<h2 id="before-you-start-your-search">Before You Start Your Search</h2>
<p>The best time to find a breeder is before you&#x27;re emotionally attached to the idea of &quot;getting a puppy soon.&quot; Great breeders often have waiting lists, and the best matches come from thoughtful planning, not impulse decisions. As a breeder, I think of myself as matching families with potential: the potential puppy that will become an amazing dog. It is part of the reason our website is not covered with pictures of cute puppies, but rather healthy, sound dogs that demonstrate our committment to producing excellent dogs.</p>
<details node="[object Object]">
<summary node="[object Object]"><strong>Setting Realistic Expectations</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Timeline Reality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quality breeders typically have 6-18 month waiting lists</li>
<li>The best breeders often breed only 1-2 litters per year</li>
<li>Puppy selection usually happens at 6-8 weeks old</li>
<li>Ideally, plan to visit the breeder in person or at least virtually, before taking your puppy home</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment Understanding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quality Great Dane puppies typically cost $2,000-$4,000+</li>
<li>Health testing adds significant costs that responsible breeders absorb</li>
<li>Often, show-quality dogs command premium prices (We have a flat fee because we put the same love and consideration into all of our dogs)</li>
<li>The most expensive puppy isn&#x27;t always the best choice for your family</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You Should Know About Yourself:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your experience level with large dogs (For me, Great Danes fall into exotic animals as much as dogs due to their unique requiremnts)</li>
<li>Your activity level and exercise commitments</li>
<li>Your preferences for male vs. female (size differences are significant)</li>
<li>Whether you&#x27;re interested in showing, performance events, or just companionship</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="essential-questions-for-every-breeder">Essential Questions for Every Breeder</h2>
<p>These questions will quickly separate serious breeders from puppy mills or backyard breeders. Pay attention not just to their answers, but to their enthusiasm for discussing these topics.</p>
<details node="[object Object]">
<summary node="[object Object]"><strong>About Their Breeding Program</strong></summary>
<p><strong>The Right Questions to Ask:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Can you explain your breeding philosophy and strategy?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Good Answer:</strong> They should articulate specific goals like temperament, health, or structure improvements. They might mention linebreeding strategies, outcrossing decisions, or working toward breed standards. Quality breeders can discuss their long-term goals spanning multiple generations.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Red Flag:</strong> &quot;We just breed our pets&quot; or vague answers about &quot;producing healthy puppies&quot; without specifics.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Why did you choose this specific pairing?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Good Answer:</strong> They should discuss how the sire and dam complement each other&#x27;s strengths and offset weaknesses. Quality breeders can explain concepts like coefficient of inbreeding (COI), discuss pedigree analysis, and explain expected outcomes. For deeper insight into this process, see our post <a href="/posts/2025-06-23-laying-the-foundation">&quot;Laying the Foundation: Science, Mentorship, and Our First 7Sisters Litters&quot;</a> where we detail our progressive breeding strategy.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Red Flag:</strong> &quot;She was in season&quot; or &quot;We liked both dogs&quot; without deeper genetic planning.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Who are your mentors in the breed?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Good Answer:</strong> They should name specific, accomplished breeders who guide their decisions. Quality breeders often co-breed with mentors, attend breed education events, and stay connected to breed clubs.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Red Flag:</strong> No mentors, or they claim to be entirely self-taught.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;What health testing do you perform?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Good Answer:</strong> At minimum: cardiac clearance, thyroid testing, and hip evaluation and eye testing. Advanced breeders may discuss genetic testing, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) screening, and breed-specific concerns. They should provide copies of all health clearances.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Red Flag:</strong> &quot;The vet says they&#x27;re healthy&quot; without specific testing, or refusal to provide documentation.</p>
</details>
<details node="[object Object]">
<summary node="[object Object]"><strong>About Their Puppies &amp; Practices</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Understanding Their Puppy Program:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;How do you socialize your puppies?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Good Answer:</strong> Detailed socialization protocols starting around 3 weeks, exposure to various sounds/surfaces/people, early neurological stimulation (ENS), and structured puppy curriculum. They should welcome families visiting to help socialize puppies.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;How do you match puppies to families?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Good Answer:</strong> Temperament testing, lifestyle questionnaires, ongoing communication about family needs, and prioritizing best fit over &quot;first come, first served.&quot; Quality breeders often maintain some control over puppy placement.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;What ongoing support do you provide?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Good Answer:</strong> Lifetime support for questions, willingness to take dogs back if needed, regular check-ins, feeding/training guidance, and connections to other puppy families. Many maintain private Facebook groups for ongoing community.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;What contracts and guarantees do you offer?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Good Answer:</strong> Written contracts covering health guarantees, spay/neuter requirements for pet puppies, return policies, and clear expectations for both parties. They should explain why contracts protect both families and dogs.</p>

<p>Health testing is non-negotiable, but understanding what tests matter and how to interpret results will help you make better decisions.</p>
<details node="[object Object]">
<summary node="[object Object]"><strong>Essential Health Clearances for Great Danes</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Required Testing:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cardiac Clearance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cardiac evaluation by a veterinary cardiologist</li>

<li>Critical due to Great Dane susceptibility to heart conditions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hip Evaluation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) certification preferred</li>
<li>PennHIP evaluation is also acceptable</li>
<li>Look for &quot;Fair&quot; or better ratings</li>
<li>Both parents should be evaluated after 24 months of age</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thyroid Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Complete thyroid panel including autoantibodies</li>
<li>OFA thyroid clearance preferred</li>

<summary node="[object Object]"><strong>How to Verify Health Testing</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Documentation You Should Receive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Copies of all health clearances for both parents</li>
<li>OFA certification numbers you can verify online</li>
<li>Veterinary reports from testing</li>
<li>Pedigree information showing health testing on ancestors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note About Missing Documentation:</strong>
If any health testing documentation is missing, there may be valid reasons. Always ask your breeder to explain why something is missing rather than assuming it&#x27;s a red flag. For example, some breeders work with dogs from other countries that have equivalent but different testing protocols, or they may be working with younger dogs that haven&#x27;t yet reached the age for certain OFA testing requirements. A responsible breeder will be transparent about why documentation might be missing and what alternative testing or timing applies.</p>
<p><strong>Red Flags in Health Testing:</strong></p>
<p>❌ <strong>Warning Signs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Refusal to provide documentation</li>
<li>&quot;The vet says they&#x27;re healthy&quot; without specific testing</li>
<li>Testing performed by non-specialists</li>
<li>Claims that testing is &quot;unnecessary&quot; for their lines</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understanding Results:</strong>
Not every dog needs perfect scores, but you should understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the breeder interprets and uses results</li>
<li>Why they chose to breed dogs with specific clearances</li>
<li>What the results mean for your puppy&#x27;s future health</li>
<li>Whether both parents complement each other&#x27;s strengths</li>
