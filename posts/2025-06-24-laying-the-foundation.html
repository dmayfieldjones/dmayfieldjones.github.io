<details node="[object Object]">
<summary node="[object Object]"><strong>Our Mentorship Chain</strong></summary>
<p>Both of our first litters involved our mentors and co-breeders Francisco Camacho (Frankie) and Jason L. Dubman (Jaye), who earned the 2023 GDCA Breeder of the Year award with twelve champions, including our foundation bitch Piper. This mentorship chain extends to Karen Martin, the first AKC Advanced Recognition Breeder of Merit to reach Platinum status for Great Danes—one of only two breeders, along with Georgia A. Hymmen, to achieve this milestone.</p>
<p>Karen Martin was the 2022 GDCA Breeder of the Year with eleven champions and continues to provide guidance to all of us. She was the first breeder outside our household to personally evaluate both of Piper&#x27;s first two litters, showing the collaborative spirit that defines responsible Great Dane breeding.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re also deeply grateful to our stud dog owners Jessica Lanae Powers and Mara Reyes for allowing us to use their exceptional studs and providing invaluable information about their dogs. This collaborative approach ensures the best possible matches for our breeding program while building lasting relationships within the Great Dane community.</p>

<p><strong>Breeding Terms Simplified</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding):</strong> 0-6% is considered outcrossing, 6-10% is moderate linebreeding, 10%+ is close linebreeding</li>
<li><strong>ALC (Ancestor Loss Coefficient):</strong> Higher percentages indicate more genetic diversity</li>
<li><strong>Linebreeding:</strong> Breeding related dogs to strengthen specific traits</li>

<ul>
<li>Sire: BISS Am GChS Fendanesylcrest N Diriso&#x27;s This Is the Right Time &quot;Rolex&quot; (COI: 2.3%), bred by Gloria Batchelor, Kathleen Fennell, and Elizabeth Barnhart, and owned by Jose M Diaz</li>

<li>Sire: Ch Legado N IZYA&#x27;s Oops! I Did It Again &quot;Sean&quot; (COI: 22.7%)</li>
<li>Dam: Ch Legado N Danekraaft&#x27;s How Can I Tell You? &quot;Piper&quot; (COI: 0.0%)</li>
<li>Resulting Litter COI: 12.5%</li>
<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Increasing linebreeding to concentrate exceptional traits</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Two Different Strategies?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>First Litter - Testing the Waters:</strong><br/>
Our initial breeding with Rolex was a moderate approach, allowing us to see how Piper&#x27;s excellent outcross genetics (0.0% COI) would blend with proven show bloodlines. The 6.2% resulting COI gave us predictable temperaments and structure while maintaining genetic diversity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Second Litter - Concentrating Excellence:</strong><br/>
For our second litter, we chose a more intensive approach. Sean carries a concentrated dose of the same exceptional bloodlines, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Am Ch PRF Fendane Have I Gone Mad (Piper&#x27;s own father)</li>
<li>Am GCh Danemark&#x27;s Diamond Cartier V Aldawn (appears multiple times)</li>
<li>The same Tequila Mockingbird and Allie-Gator lines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding) values mentioned in this post are calculated from pedigrees and serve as a proxy for true genetic COI. Actual genetic diversity can only be determined through DNA testing, so pedigree-based COI should be interpreted as an estimate rather than an absolute measure.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="the-science-behind-our-strategy">The Science Behind Our Strategy</h2>
<details node="[object Object]">
<summary node="[object Object]"><strong>Detailed Breeding Analysis</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Compounding Excellence: Shared Key Ancestors Between Both Litters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Am Ch Saul&#x27;s Tequila Mockingbird</li>
<li>Am GCh Fendanesylcrests See You Later Allie-Gator</li>
<li>Am Ch PRF Fendane Have I Gone Mad (Piper&#x27;s father + in both sires)</li>
</ul>
<p>What this means:</p>
<p>Both litters are getting these same influential dogs from both parents.
We&#x27;re essentially linebreeding on the same key ancestors in both litters.
The second litter intensifies these influences because Sean himself is more linebred on these same lines.</p>
<p>The pattern shows: Heavy reliance on Fendane/Fendanesylcrest bloodlines across our entire breeding program. While this can fix type and create consistency, it also explains why both litters have elevated COI despite our foundation bitch starting with 0.0%.
This is evidence of our breeding decisions: following a specific linebreeding strategy focused on these particular bloodlines, demonstrating the kind of careful genetic planning that responsible breeding requires.</p>

<details node="[object Object]">
<summary node="[object Object]"><strong>How COI is Calculated: A Real Example Using Sean</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Understanding Coefficient of Inbreeding Through Sean&#x27;s Pedigree</strong></p>
<p>The coefficient of inbreeding (COI) quantifies the likelihood that an individual inherits two copies of the same region of DNA from a common ancestor. Odds are you are not one to break out equations to explicilty explain things, but calculating a COI from a pedigree is a right of passage for all dog nerds. In real life, nearly everyone uses software to make these calculations, but in case the power goes out or your internet fails, it is a good idea to at least have went through this exercise so we can rebuild knowledge if civilization ends, ha! Let&#x27;s use our own Sean (22.7% COI) as a concrete example of how this calculation works.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step COI Calculation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Identify Common Ancestors</strong>
Sean&#x27;s COI comes from multiple dogs appearing on both his mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s sides. Let&#x27;s trace one example:</p>
<p><strong>Am GCh Danemark&#x27;s Diamond Cartier V Aldawn</strong> appears twice in Sean&#x27;s pedigree:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Father&#x27;s side:</strong> Cartier is Sean&#x27;s paternal grandfather (2 generations back)</li>
<li><strong>Mother&#x27;s side:</strong> Cartier appears as a maternal great-grandfather (3 generations back)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Calculate the Probability</strong>
Using the formula: f = (1/2)^(n1 + n2 + 1) × (1 + F(A))</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>n1 = 2 (generations from father&#x27;s side to Cartier)</li>
<li>n2 = 3 (generations from mother&#x27;s side to Cartier)</li>
<li>F(A) = 0.0% (Cartier&#x27;s own COI)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. The Math</strong>
f = (1/2)^(2 + 3 + 1) × (1 + 0.0)
f = (1/2)^6 × 1
f = 1/64 = <strong>1.56%</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Why Sean&#x27;s Total COI is 22.7%</strong>
This 1.56% represents just <strong>one</strong> common ancestor! Sean&#x27;s COI comes from <strong>multiple</strong> shared ancestors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cartier appears through different paths</li>
<li><strong>NORDCH Diplomatic&#x27;s Umberto di Visconti</strong> appears multiple times</li>
<li>Several other Danemark dogs appear repeatedly</li>
</ul>
<p>The 22.7% total represents the sum of ALL these individual contributions.</p>
<p><strong>5. What This Means for Breeding</strong>
When we bred Sean to Piper (0.0% COI), we were using Sean&#x27;s genetics from proven bloodlines while relying on Piper&#x27;s outcross genetics to balance the linebreeding. This strategic approach gave us the 12.5% COI in their puppies—concentrated enough to predict type and temperament, but moderated by Piper&#x27;s (and Sean&#x27;s) genetic diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Pedigree-based COI calculations assume founder dogs are unrelated and serve as estimates. Genetic COI through DNA testing provides more accurate assessments by accounting for some of the actual genetic recombination.</p>
