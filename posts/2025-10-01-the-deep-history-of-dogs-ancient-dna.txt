As Shipman describes it, \"A dingo is a wolf on its way to becoming a dog, that never got there.\" Unlike the Americas, where dogs spread with agriculture, dingoes in Australia maintained a unique relationship: Aboriginal people would take dingo puppies from dens and raise them, but the dingoes were left to breed in the wild without human manipulation. They retained wolf-like traits including annual breeding cycles, howling instead of barking, and only 2 copies of the AMY2B gene for starch digestion—the ancestral condition before dogs adapted to agricultural diets. This suggests dingoes represent a genetic and behavioral midpoint between wolves and dogs, providing a living window into what started the domestication process."]}],"\n",["$","p","p-25",{"children":["As ",["$","a","a-0",{"href":"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674971937","children":"Pat Shipman argues in her book \"Our Oldest Companions\""}],", this wasn't a one-sided process of humans \"domesticating\" wolves, but rather a complex mutual integration where both species evolved together.
