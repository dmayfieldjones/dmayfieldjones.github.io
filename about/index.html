  Pictured are the seven sisters that lived in the brick house. The farm had stayed in the same family 
  for more than 100 years until it was aquired in March 2007 and restored by Cathe Capel of Seven Sisters. Dustin and Karen were welcomed into the home in April 2023, and the name of the farm was modified to <FONT COLOR="#bf141c">7</FONT>Sisters to reflect 
  the new stewards of the property.

  From "A Brief History of the Brick House" <br>
  by George Clark
  <br>
  The brick house was built by James Michael and Mahalia Ann West. It was started in 1893 and finished in 1895. James Michael West farmed something in excess of 240 acres.
  In addition he operated a sawmill [built in the 1830s by George Akers, remains of the mill were on the property owned by James Michael West after 1854] and a brickyard. 
  James Michael's sawmill produced the wood used in the house. His brickyard made the bricks. He took a wagon load of lumber to Decatur 
  to be dried and milled for the trim work.  The parlor fireplace millwork is quarter sawn Sycamore. Oak and Pine trim the other rooms. <br>
  <br>
  The home is all brick construction; both load bearing interior and exterior walls are multiple courses of brick, not brick veneer as is common today. When the house was first finished
  in 1895 it had central heat, a water system, an indoor bathroom complete with tub and commode and gas lights. When the orignial single pane windows were replaced with insulated double pane windows, 
  the stained glass windows that were original to the house were reinstalled in front of the replacement windows.<br>
  <br>
  James Michael and Mahalia Ann West, my great grandparents, lived in the home until their death, at which time it passed to my grandparents James Harvey ("Harv") and Ruby West. They lived in the house
  until James Harvey's death. Ruby West continued to live in the house, until she could no longer care for it and moved in with her daughter, my mother, Mary Clark. The house was then occupied
  by one of Ruby's grandchildren until her death, at which time the house passed to her daughter, Mary Clark. At this time, Theresa Rogers, Mary's granddaaughter, my daughter, and her family occupied 
  the home. The home became my property after my mother's death and I passed it on to Theresa. Theresa and her family lived in the home until her death.
