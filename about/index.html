            Pictured are the seven sisters that lived in the brick house. The farm had stayed in the same family 
            for more than 100 years until it was acquired in 2007 and further restored by Cathe Capel of Seven Sisters. 
            Dustin and Karen were welcomed into the home in 2023, and the name of the farm was modified to 
            <span class="accent-color">7</span>Sisters to reflect the new stewards of the property.

                    The brick house was built by James Michael and Mahalia Ann West. It was started in 1893 
                    and finished in 1895. James Michael West farmed something in excess of 240 acres. 
                    In addition he operated a sawmill [built in the 1830s by George Akers, remains of the 
                    mill were on the property owned by James Michael West after 1854] and a brickyard. 
                    James Michael's sawmill produced the wood used in the house. His brickyard made the bricks. 
                    He took a wagon load of lumber to Decatur to be dried and milled for the trim work. 
                    The parlor fireplace millwork is quarter sawn Sycamore. Oak and Pine trim the other rooms.

                    The home is all brick construction; both load bearing interior and exterior walls are 
                    multiple courses of brick, not brick veneer as is common today. When the house was first 
                    finished in 1895 it had central heat, a water system, an indoor bathroom complete with 
                    tub and commode and gas lights. When the original single pane windows were replaced with 
                    insulated double pane windows, the stained glass windows that were original to the house 
                    were reinstalled in front of the replacement windows.

                    James Michael and Mahalia Ann West, my great grandparents, lived in the home until their 
                    death, at which time it passed to my grandparents James Harvey ("Harv") and Ruby West. 
                    They lived in the house until James Harvey's death. Ruby West continued to live in the 
                    house, until she could no longer care for it and moved in with her daughter, my mother, 
                    Mary Clark. The house was then occupied by one of Ruby's grandchildren until her death, 
                    at which time the house passed to her daughter, Mary Clark. At this time, Theresa Rogers, 
                    Mary's granddaughter, my daughter, and her family occupied the home. The home became my 
                    property after my mother's death and I passed it on to Theresa. Theresa and her family 
                    lived in the home until her death.
