Breeding for Temperament: What Current Research Tools Tell Us (And What They Don't)\n\nAs preservationist breeders, we make complex decisions based on three fundamental pillars: conformation, health, and temperament. All three are essential to producing dogs that fulfill their breed's purpose and thrive as modern companions.\n\nWhen evaluating conformation, we have more established tools and terminology at our disposal. I can put my hands on a potential stud dog and assess his structural fit for my dams. We have detailed breed standards, standardized terminology, and generations of documented pedigree data. We know what constitutes a conformational fault and would never deliberately double down on structural weaknesses that compromise function or soundness.\n\nYet when it comes to temperament ‚Äì equally crucial to breeding decisions ‚Äì we're working with far less precise tools. We lack standardized assessment methods, consistent terminology, and reliable ways to share behavioral information across breeding programs. This disparity creates a significant gap in our ability to make informed decisions about one of the most important aspects of our dogs.\n\nInterestingly, many of the same limitations we see in temperament assessment tools also apply to health testing. Most health tests provide snapshots in time rather than definitive genetic predictions, and environmental factors like injuries can affect results without representing heritable traits. This suggests that the challenge of meaningful assessment isn't unique to temperament; it's a broader issue in breeding decision-making.\n\nAs breeders, we're often asked about temperament. Puppy buyers want to know if their future dog will be good with children, how they'll handle apartment living, or whether they'll excel in specific activities. When we turn to scientific research for temperament assessment guidance, we discover that even the most advanced tools serve clinical and research purposes, not breeding selection.\n\n## The Current Assessment Landscape\n\nSeveral assessment approaches dominate how we evaluate canine behavior and temperament:\n\n**C-BARQ** represents the gold standard, using 100 validated questions to evaluate 14 behavioral factors plus 22 additional behavioral measures. A shortened version, C-BARQ(S), with 42 questions, was created to be a more convenient tool for assessing behavioral problems in dogs, especially those in shelter environments. Both versions focus on behavioral problems rather than personality traits, using owner reports of how dogs respond to everyday situations. They're scientifically rigorous but designed for clinical and research purposes, not breeding selection.\n\n**Other questionnaires** like the Monash Behavioral Questionnaire and Dog Personality Questionnaire rely heavily on owner interpretation without clear definitions, making results highly subjective and inconsistent between owners.\n\n**Performance titles** demonstrate specific skills under controlled conditions but don't predict general temperament or home suitability.\n\n## Why Existing Tools Fall Short for Breeders\n\n**The Interpretation Problem**\nMany assessment tools ask owners to make judgments without providing clear definitions. When the Monash behavioral questionnaire asks about \"aggressive\" behavior, one owner might consider any barking aggressive while another reserves the term for actual biting. This inconsistency makes data nearly useless for breeding decisions where precision matters.\n\n**They Focus on Problems, Not Potential**\nThe C-BARQ excels at identifying behavioral issues ‚Äì separation anxiety, aggression, fearfulness. While valuable for clinical purposes, breeders need to understand the full spectrum of temperament, including positive traits that make dogs wonderful companions. A questionnaire designed to diagnose problems tells us little about breeding for desirable characteristics.\n\n**Performance Doesn't Equal Suitability**\nTrial success demonstrates specific skills under controlled conditions, not general temperament or home suitability. These tools measure narrow performance windows, not the broad adaptability that makes a good family companion.\n\n**They Measure Current Reality, Not Genetic Potential**\nAll these questionnaires assess how individual dogs behave right now, in their current environments, with their current owners. Breeding decisions require understanding which traits are heritable and how they might express across different contexts and generations.\n\n**They Don't Account for \"Fit\"**\nA dog that scores high for \"excitability\" might be problematic for an elderly owner but perfect for an active family. Current tools measure traits in isolation, without helping match genetic potential to appropriate homes or lifestyles.\n\n**They're Backwards-Looking**\nMost assessment tools evaluate adult dogs who've already developed their behavioral patterns through the complex interaction of genetics, early experience, and training. Breeders need to predict how puppies will develop based on parental traits and breeding program goals.\n\n## What These Tools Can Teach Us\n\nDespite their limitations for breeding applications, current research offers valuable insights:\n\n**Behavioral Traits Cluster in Predictable Ways**\nThe C-BARQ's factor analysis reveals that certain behaviors group together. Dogs high in stranger-directed fear often show nonsocial fear as well. This suggests we should think about temperament as interconnected systems rather than isolated traits ‚Äì a crucial insight for breeding decisions.\n\n**Owner Perception Shapes Success**\nThe MDORS research demonstrates that a \"good\" temperament isn't just about what the dog does ‚Äì it's about whether the owner finds those behaviors acceptable and manageable. A high-energy dog isn't inherently problematic; they're only problematic if they don't match their owner's lifestyle and expectations.\n\n**Context Shapes Expression**\nAll assessment tools demonstrate that behavior is highly situational. The same dog might be confident at home but fearful in new environments. This reinforces the critical importance of early socialization and environmental consistency in expressing genetic potential.\n\n**Specific Scenarios Trump General Labels**\nThe C-BARQ's strength lies in asking about concrete situations: \"How does your dog respond when approached by an unfamiliar child while on-leash?\" This approach proves far more useful than asking whether a dog is \"good with kids\" or \"friendly\" ‚Äì terms that mean different things to different people.\n\n**Performance Has Narrow Predictive Value**\nWhile obedience titles don't predict home suitability, they do indicate specific capacities: focus, stress tolerance in novel environments, and responsiveness to handler cues. These traits matter for some breeding goals, even if they don't guarantee general temperament quality.\n\n## What Are We Actually Selecting For?\n\nCurrent research tools often focus on problems to avoid rather than positive traits to cultivate. Key temperament considerations include:\n\n- **Resilience and recovery ability** - bouncing back from negative experiences\n- **Biddability and trainability** - genuine interest in working with people  \n- **Stable reactivity** - proportional responses to stimuli\n- **Appropriate social interest** - friendly but controlled interactions\n- **Environmental confidence** - curiosity rather than fear in new situations\n- **Impulse control** - ability to wait and settle appropriately\n- **Handling tolerance** - accepting necessary care with minimal stress\n- **Size-appropriate behavior** - especially crucial for large breeds like Great Danes\n\nNo universal \"perfect\" temperament exists ‚Äì only temperaments that fit well with their intended roles and families.\n\n## Practical Applications for Breeders\n\nCurrent research offers immediate guidance for improving our temperament assessment: ask specific questions about concrete situations rather than general traits, observe breeding dogs across varied contexts, and track long-term outcomes with puppy buyers to understand how your lines develop over time.\n\nThe research tools show us that better assessment is possible ‚Äì with clearer definitions, specific scenarios, and standardized terminology. But we're not using these tools to their greatest power because we as individual breeders don't have teams of scientists at our disposal. The real opportunity lies in better data collection, organization, and changing how we think about temperament assessment rather than waiting for new tools.\n\nScientists are already collecting this data through projects like Darwin's Ark and the Dog Aging Project, but as the Functional Breeding Podcast recently discussed, applying these clinical research tools to practical breeding decisions remains extremely challenging. Even with large-scale data collection, translating research findings into actionable breeding decisions is far more complex than simply having better assessment tools.\n\n## The Great Dane Breeder's Challenge\n\nAs Great Dane breeders, we face unique challenges in temperament assessment. Our dogs' size means temperament problems that might be manageable in smaller breeds can become serious safety concerns. A fearful 20-pound dog might hide under furniture; a fearful 140-pound Great Dane might panic and cause injury.\n\nWe need temperament assessment tools that account for:\n- **Size-appropriate behavior**: How dogs handle their physical presence\n- **Breed-specific social roles**: Guardian instincts vs. companion needs\n- **Modern living requirements**: Adaptability to urban/suburban environments\n- **Safety considerations**: Predictable responses to common situations\n\nThe stakes are higher with Great Danes ‚Äì we're not just breeding for temperament, we're breeding for safe, appropriate behavior in a large, powerful breed that will share homes with families, children, and other pets.\n\nThe research discussed in this blog post highlights both the problem and potential solutions. Just as we wouldn't breed two dogs with the same conformational weakness, we shouldn't unknowingly concentrate negative temperament traits that compromise a dog's ability to succeed in their intended role. But without better assessment and communication tools, we risk doing exactly that.\n\nImagine if we had temperament assessment tools as refined as our conformation evaluation methods. We could systematically identify and select for positive traits while avoiding the concentration of problematic behaviors. We could share detailed, standardized temperament information with the same precision we use for hip scores or genetic test results. Puppy buyers could make informed decisions based on reliable behavioral predictions, not just hopes and general descriptions.\n\n## The Road Forward\n\nThe science is catching up to what thoughtful breeders have always known ‚Äì temperament is complex, heritable, and profoundly important. Current assessment tools offer valuable methodological insights: the importance of specific behavioral description, the need for clear definitions, and the recognition that temperament exists within the context of human-dog relationships.\n\nResponsible breeders have always been geneticists and behaviorists, making complex decisions about temperament with limited tools. We can apply lessons from current research while continuing to develop our own observation skills and breeding judgment.\n\n## Sources\n\n**Primary Research Papers:**\n\nHsu, Y., \u0026 Serpell, J.

New Great Dane families often panic at this point‚Äîis something wrong? Are they starving their dog? How much is too much?\n\nYes, Great Danes are dogs, but they‚Äôre also exotic pets. If your family grew up with a Miniature Schnauzer or Dachshunds‚Äîlike me and Karen‚Äîyou‚Äôre in for a rude awakening. They are big dogs. I like to (somewhat jokingly) say that the first rule of Great Danes is: ‚ÄúProtect your knees and teeth!‚Äù\n\nThe truth about feeding Great Danes challenges everything most people know about dog nutrition. These gentle giants don't just eat more food‚Äîthey require fundamentally different nutritional strategies that account for their unique growth patterns, metabolism, and long-term health needs.\n\nAfter multiple litters, conversations with families about feeding challenges, and over 15 years in the breed, we've learned that nutrition confusion causes more anxiety than almost any other aspect of Great Dane ownership. We share this information to help ease the anxiety of both our 7Sisters families and ourselves as breeders. This guide draws from our experience raising champions, mentorship from accomplished breeders, and the latest research in giant breed nutrition to help you navigate every feeding decision with confidence.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKey Takeaways\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n- Great Danes require nutrition strategies tailored to their unique growth and metabolism‚Äîgeneric dog feeding advice does not apply.\n- Controlled, steady growth is essential; overfeeding and rapid growth increase the risk of orthopedic problems.\n- Use a Great Dane-appropriate formula with controlled calcium and phosphorus; avoid most generic ‚Äúpuppy‚Äù foods.\n- Monitor body condition, not just portion size‚Äîlet your hands, not your eyes, guide feeding adjustments.\n- Never free-feed; stick to scheduled, measured meals and adjust as your dog grows.\n- Bloat is a serious risk‚Äîfeed smaller, frequent meals, use slow-feed bowls, and avoid exercise around mealtimes.\n- Consult your veterinarian regularly for growth monitoring and diet adjustments.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Great Dane Growth and Nutrition: Why Size Changes Everything\n\nGreat Danes don't just scale up from smaller dogs‚Äîtheir nutritional needs are qualitatively different. Understanding these differences prevents costly mistakes and sets your dog up for lifelong health.\n\n### Great Dane Puppy Growth Rate: What to Expect\n\n**The Numbers That Matter:**\n- Birth weight: 1-2 pounds\n- 8 weeks: 15-25 pounds  \n- 6 months: 65-90 pounds\n- 12 months: 100-140 pounds\n- Adult weight: 110-180+ pounds\n\n\u003e For a detailed month-by-month breakdown of what to expect in your puppy‚Äôs first year‚Äîincluding milestones, growth spurts, and care tips‚Äîsee [The First Year: A Month-by-Month Guide to Early Great Dane Development](/posts/2025-07-03-the-first-year).\n\nYour Great Dane puppy will gain approximately **2-4 pounds per week** during peak growth periods. This represents a **9,000% increase** from birth to adult weight for many Great Danes‚Äîa growth rate that places enormous demands on developing joints, bones, and organ systems.\n\n**Why This Matters for Feeding:**\n- **Controlled growth prevents orthopedic problems** - Fast growth increases hip dysplasia and other developmental issues\n- **Nutrient timing is critical** - Missing key nutrients during growth spurts causes permanent problems  \n- **Overfeeding is more dangerous than underfeeding** - Excess calories accelerate growth beyond what bones can support\n- **Traditional feeding advice doesn't apply** - Recommendations for 30-pound dogs fail catastrophically with giants\n\n\n\n### Unique Metabolic Needs of Great Danes\n\nGiant breeds have proportionally **slower metabolisms per pound** than smaller dogs. Piper, who is four at the time of this writing, maintains her adult weight on fewer calories per pound than many other breeds, and this efficiency begins early in puppyhood.\n\n**Key Metabolic Facts:**\n- **Lower caloric needs per pound** of body weight compared to smaller breeds\n- Different protein requirements throughout growth\n- Unique calcium and phosphorus ratios\n- Different response to dietary fat\n\n## 7Sisters Farm‚Äôs Great Dane Feeding Philosophy\n\nOur approach reflects the experience of our mentors, whose champion dogs demonstrate the results of proper nutrition, combined with guidance from our veterinarians who specialize in giant breed health.\n\n### Core Principles for Feeding Great Dane Puppies and Adults\n\n**1. Controlled Growth Over Maximum Growth**\nWe never strive for the fastest-growing puppies. Our goal is steady, sustainable growth that supports proper joint development and long-term soundness.\n\n**2. Life Stage Precision**\nFeeding requirements change dramatically between 8 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years. Generic \"puppy food\" doesn't address these transitions.\n\n**3. Individual Monitoring**\nEvery dog is different. Cora required different feeding strategies than Mia, even though they're half-sisters from similar breeding.\n\n**4. Quality Over Quantity**\nPremium nutrition costs more upfront but prevents expensive health problems and supports better development.\n\n**5. Veterinary Partnership**\nRegular body condition scoring and growth monitoring with our veterinarian guides feeding adjustments.\n\n## Great Dane Feeding Strategies by Life Stage\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNewborn to 8 Weeks: Foundation Phase\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**What We Control at 7Sisters:**\nDuring this critical period, puppies receive optimal nutrition through their mother's milk supplemented with high-quality weaning foods starting around 3-4 weeks.\n\n**Our Weaning Protocol:**\n- **3-4 weeks:** Introduction of moistened premium food\n- **4-5 weeks:** Gradual transition to solid food\n- **6-8 weeks:** Independent eating while still nursing occasionally\n\n**What This Means for Families:**\nBy the time you bring your puppy home, they're already established on a feeding routine that supports healthy growth. We provide detailed transition instructions to maintain this foundation.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8 Weeks to 6 Months: Rapid Growth Phase\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**The Challenge:**\nThis period requires the most precise nutrition management. Growth is rapid but must be controlled to prevent orthopedic problems.\n\n**Our Recommended Approach:**\n\n**Food Selection:**\n- **Great Dane appropriate formula** with controlled calcium (1.0-1.2%) and phosphorus (0.8-1.0%)\n- **Moderate protein levels** (24-26%) to support growth without excess\n- **Premium brands** with consistent quality and nutritional analysis\n- **Avoid \"puppy\"** formulas that often contain excessive nutrients\n\n**Feeding Schedule:**\n- **8-12 weeks:** 4 meals daily, measured portions\n- **3-4 months:** 2-3 meals daily\n- **4-6 months:** 2 meals daily, increasing portion sizes\n- **Free feeding is never appropriate** for Great Danes\n\n**Portion Guidelines:**\nIn addition to considering feeding charts as guides, we monitor:\n- **Body condition scoring** - ribs easily felt but not visible\n- **Growth rate** - steady gain without excessive speed\n- **Energy levels** - active but not hyperactive\n- **Stool quality** - formed, consistent\n\n**Red Flags During This Phase:**\n- Visible ribs or hip bones (underfeeding)\n- No waist tuck when viewed from above (overfeeding)  \n- Excessive panting or lethargy after eating\n- Loose stools or inconsistent appetite\n- Growth spurts exceeding 5+ pounds per week\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6 Months to 18 Months: Adolescent Phase\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**The Reality:**\nThis is when families get overwhelmed. Appetites surge, growth continues, but nutritional needs begin shifting toward adult requirements.\n\n**Feeding Transitions:**\n\n**6-12 Months:**\n- Monitor for adolescent growth spurts\n- Adjust portions based on body condition, not appetite\n\n**12-18 Months:**\n- **Slower growth rate** - focus shifts to filling out rather than growing up\n- **Portion stabilization** - amounts become more predictable\n\n**Managing Adolescent Appetite:**\nMia went through a phase where she acted starving despite adequate nutrition. This is normal! Great Dane adolescents often have enormous appetites that don't reflect actual nutritional needs.\n\n**Our Strategies:**\n- **Measure everything** - everyone needs to know how much they are feeding to properly make adjusements when neceessary\n- **Maintain schedule** - consistent meal times prevent food anxiety\n- **Monitor body condition** - let your hands guide portions\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e18 Months to Adult: Maturation Phase\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**The Goal:**\nTransition to adult maintenance nutrition while supporting final development phases.\n\n**Adult Food Selection:**\n- **High-quality adult formula** appropriate for large breeds\n- **Moderate protein** (20-24%) for maintenance\n- **Controlled fat levels** to prevent excessive weight gain\n- **Consider all-natural or limited ingredient** options for dogs with sensitivities\n\n**Portion Management:**\nAdult Great Danes typically eat **4-8 cups daily** depending on:\n- Individual metabolism\n- Activity level\n- Spay/neuter status\n- Seasonal variations\n- Age and health status\n\n**Managing Adult Appetite:**\n- **Add small amounts (less than 10% by weight) of low-calorie bulk** - green beans, carrots for satiety without excess calories\n- **Monitor weight trends** - adjust portions based on body condition, not begging\n- **Consider seasonal needs** - many dogs need more food in winter\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Choosing the Best Dog Food for Great Danes: Brands, Types, and Quality\n\n### Our Recommended Approach\n\n**What We Feed at 7Sisters:**\nWe've had excellent results with Purina Pro Plan Large Breed kibble combined with a varied diet of healthy additives and snacks (less than 10% by weight) for both puppies and adults. However, the brand matters less than understanding what to look for in any premium food.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Choose Purina Pro Plan for 7Sisters Great Danes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**The Case for Pro Plan with Great Danes:**\n\n**Research-Backed Nutrition:**\n- Purina operates one of the world's largest pet nutrition research facilities\n- Conducts actual feeding trials, not just \"meets AAFCO standards\" formulation\n- Long-term studies on large breed development inform their formulations\n- Decades of research specifically on giant breed growth and development\n\n**Practical Advantages for Great Dane Families:**\n- **Consistent availability** - no supply chain nightmares when you need 50+ pounds monthly\n- **Cost-effective** - feeding a 150-pound dog premium boutique food gets expensive fast ($200+/month)\n- **Multiple life stage formulas** - smooth transitions within brand as dogs mature\n- **Proven track record** - many successful Great Dane breeders have used it for decades\n\n**Great Dane-Specific Benefits:**\n- Large Breed formulations with appropriate calcium/phosphorus ratios (1.0-1.2% Ca)\n- Controlled protein levels (24-26%) suitable for controlled growth\n- Kibble size appropriate for large mouths and proper chewing\n- Traditional grain-inclusive formulas (avoiding potential DCM links from grain-free diets)\n- Consistent nutrient profiles batch-to-batch\n\n**Addressing Common Concerns:**\n\n**\"But what about the ingredients?\"**\nWhile Pro Plan contains some ingredients that \"food purists\" dislike (corn, by-products), these ingredients serve nutritional purposes and are backed by research. Corn provides digestible carbohydrates, and properly processed by-products can be excellent protein sources. We prioritize proven results over marketing claims.\n\n**\"Isn't there something better?\"**\n\"Better\" depends on your definition. More expensive doesn't always mean more appropriate for your dog. Some boutique brands actually have calcium levels too high for growing giants or use novel proteins that can trigger sensitivities. Pro Plan's extensive research specifically on large breed nutrition makes it a smart choice for Great Danes.\n\n**Our Experience:**\n- All our breeding dogs maintain excellent body condition on Pro Plan\n- Consistent, healthy coat quality across all our dogs\n- Most puppies transition smoothly to new homes on Pro Plan\n- Families report easy transitions and satisfied dogs\n- Cost allows families to invest in other important areas (training, veterinary care)\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nPro Plan is scientifically sound, consistently available, and has a proven track record with giant breeds. For our breeding program, it represents a practical, research-backed choice that families can actually afford and access. We prioritize results over marketing, and our dogs' health and condition demonstrate those results.\n\n*Note: Every dog is an individual. While Pro Plan works well for our dogs and most of our puppy families, some dogs may require special diets due to allergies or medical conditions. For example, during certain stages of adolescent development, we‚Äôve found that alternative diets may be more effective for managing or reducing muzzle furunculosis in some of our dogs. Always work with your veterinarian to determine the best nutrition plan for your specific dog.*\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n\nTo choose the best food for your Great Dane, look for the following quality indicators on the label and from the manufacturer:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKey Quality Indicators\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**Label Analysis:**\n- **Named meat sources** as first ingredients\n- **Calcium between 1.0-1.4%** for puppies, 1.0-1.2% for adults\n- **Phosphorus ratios** appropriate to calcium levels  \n- **AAFCO feeding trials completed** (not just \"formulated to meet\")\n- **No by-product meals** as primary protein sources\n\n**Manufacturer Standards:**\n- **Consistent quality control** - same nutritional analysis batch to batch\n- **Research backing** - studies supporting their formulations\n- **Veterinary consultation** in formula development\n- **Recall history** - transparent communication about any issues\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Dry, Wet, and Raw Diets for Great Danes: Pros and Cons\n\nHere‚Äôs a comparison of the main diet types for Great Danes.

Understanding what to expect during each stage helps families provide appropriate care, training, and nutrition while recognizing normal development from concerning changes.\n\nThis guide draws from our experience raising multiple litters, ongoing mentorship from accomplished breeders, and observations from families who've welcomed 7Sisters puppies into their homes. We'll cover physical development, behavioral milestones, training opportunities, and health considerations for each month of your Great Dane's crucial first year.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKey Takeaways\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n- Great Dane puppies grow rapidly‚Äîexpect major changes every month in size, behavior, and needs.\n- Growth plates may remain open until 18‚Äì24 months; avoid early spay/neuter and excessive exercise.\n- Feed for slow, steady growth using large-breed-appropriate feed; overfeeding can cause orthopedic issues.\n- Early socialization, training, and veterinary care are critical for a healthy, well-adjusted adult.\n- Ongoing support from your breeder and a Dane-experienced vet is essential‚Äîdon't hesitate to ask questions.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003e **A Note Before You Begin:**  \n\u003e There's a wealth of information about Great Danes available online, and many experienced breeders, veterinarians, and experts have written about every aspect of Dane care in far greater detail. My goal here is to provide a practical, organized resource that brings together the basics in one place‚Äîso you can find answers quickly and learn a lot fast. Every puppy develops at their own pace, and the timelines in this guide represent typical development, but individual variation is normal. You must always consult a veterinarian who is knowledgeable about Great Danes regarding your specific puppy's growth and health needs, and confirm that your vet understands the unique requirements of this breed. Don't hesitate to seek out multiple sources, ask questions, and use your best judgment. What matters most is finding what works best for your individual dog and family.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGreat Dane Puppy Development: Birth to 2 Weeks (The Neonatal Period)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**Physical Development:**\n- **Birth weight:** 1-2 pounds (450-900 grams).\n- **Eyes and ears closed**‚Äîpuppies rely entirely on touch and smell.\n- **Limited mobility**‚Äîmostly sleeping and nursing.\n- **Umbilical cord detaches** around day 1-3.\n- **Daily weight gain:** During the first week, puppies should gain about 10‚Äì15% of their birth weight per day.

While a Chihuahua might have her first heat at 6-8 months, Great Danes usually take longer to reach sexual maturity.

With so many breeders claiming to be \"responsible,\" how do you identify those who truly prioritize your family's needs and the breed's welfare?\n\nThis guide draws from our experience in the Great Dane community and the lessons we've learned about what separates exceptional breeders from the rest. Whether you're a first-time Great Dane owner or adding to your pack, these questions will help you make an informed choice.\n\n**Before You Start:** This guide assumes you've already decided on a Great Dane and understand the breed's basic requirements.

As a breeder, I think of myself as matching families with potential: the potential puppy that will become an amazing dog. It is part of the reason our website is not covered with pictures of cute puppies, but rather healthy, sound dogs that demonstrate our committment to producing excellent dogs.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSetting Realistic Expectations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**Timeline Reality:**\n- Quality breeders typically have 6-18 month waiting lists\n- The best breeders often breed only 1-2 litters per year\n- Puppy selection usually happens at 6-8 weeks old\n- Ideally, plan to visit the breeder in person or at least virtually, before taking your puppy home\n\n**Investment Understanding:**\n- Quality Great Dane puppies typically cost $2,000-$4,000+\n- Health testing adds significant costs that responsible breeders absorb\n- Often, show-quality dogs command premium prices (We have a flat fee because we put the same love and consideration into all of our dogs)\n- The most expensive puppy isn't always the best choice for your family\n\n**What You Should Know About Yourself:**\n- Your experience level with large dogs (For me, Great Danes fall into exotic animals as much as dogs due to their unique requiremnts)\n- Your activity level and exercise commitments\n- Your preferences for male vs. female (size differences are significant)\n- Whether you're interested in showing, performance events, or just companionship\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Essential Questions for Every Breeder\n\nThese questions will quickly separate serious breeders from puppy mills or backyard breeders. Pay attention not just to their answers, but to their enthusiasm for discussing these topics.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Their Breeding Program\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**The Right Questions to Ask:**\n\n**\"Can you explain your breeding philosophy and strategy?\"**\n\n‚úÖ **Good Answer:** They should articulate specific goals like temperament, health, or structure improvements. They might mention linebreeding strategies, outcrossing decisions, or working toward breed standards. Quality breeders can discuss their long-term goals spanning multiple generations.\n\n‚ùå **Red Flag:** \"We just breed our pets\" or vague answers about \"producing healthy puppies\" without specifics.\n\n**\"Why did you choose this specific pairing?\"**\n\n‚úÖ **Good Answer:** They should discuss how the sire and dam complement each other's strengths and offset weaknesses. Quality breeders can explain concepts like coefficient of inbreeding (COI), discuss pedigree analysis, and explain expected outcomes. For deeper insight into this process, see our post [\"Laying the Foundation: Science, Mentorship, and Our First 7Sisters Litters\"](/posts/2025-06-23-laying-the-foundation) where we detail our progressive breeding strategy.\n\n‚ùå **Red Flag:** \"She was in season\" or \"We liked both dogs\" without deeper genetic planning.\n\n**\"Who are your mentors in the breed?\"**\n\n‚úÖ **Good Answer:** They should name specific, accomplished breeders who guide their decisions. Quality breeders often co-breed with mentors, attend breed education events, and stay connected to breed clubs.\n\n‚ùå **Red Flag:** No mentors, or they claim to be entirely self-taught.\n\n**\"What health testing do you perform?\"**\n\n‚úÖ **Good Answer:** At minimum: cardiac clearance, thyroid testing, and hip evaluation and eye testing. Advanced breeders may discuss genetic testing, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) screening, and breed-specific concerns. They should provide copies of all health clearances.\n\n‚ùå **Red Flag:** \"The vet says they're healthy\" without specific testing, or refusal to provide documentation.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Their Puppies \u0026 Practices\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**Understanding Their Puppy Program:**\n\n**\"How do you socialize your puppies?\"**\n\n‚úÖ **Good Answer:** Detailed socialization protocols starting around 3 weeks, exposure to various sounds/surfaces/people, early neurological stimulation (ENS), and structured puppy curriculum. They should welcome families visiting to help socialize puppies.\n\n**\"How do you match puppies to families?\"**\n\n‚úÖ **Good Answer:** Temperament testing, lifestyle questionnaires, ongoing communication about family needs, and prioritizing best fit over \"first come, first served.\" Quality breeders often maintain some control over puppy placement.\n\n**\"What ongoing support do you provide?\"**\n\n‚úÖ **Good Answer:** Lifetime support for questions, willingness to take dogs back if needed, regular check-ins, feeding/training guidance, and connections to other puppy families. Many maintain private Facebook groups for ongoing community.\n\n**\"What contracts and guarantees do you offer?\"**\n\n‚úÖ **Good Answer:** Written contracts covering health guarantees, spay/neuter requirements for pet puppies, return policies, and clear expectations for both parties. They should explain why contracts protect both families and dogs.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Red Flags vs. Green Flags\n\nSome warning signs are obvious, but others require knowing what excellent breeders actually do.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMajor Red Flags\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è **Immediate Concerns:**\n- **Always has puppies available** - Quality breeding requires careful timing\n- **Won't let you visit** - Legitimate breeders welcome visits\n- **Can't provide health clearances** - Non-negotiable for responsible breeding\n- **Sells to pet stores** - Responsible breeders place puppies personally\n- **Multiple breeds** - Expertise requires focus\n- **Pressure to decide quickly** - Good breeders want thoughtful matches\n- **No questions about you** - They should screen families carefully\n- **Won't take dogs back** - Lifetime commitment is standard\n\nüö© **Subtle Warning Signs:**\n- Focus on \"rare\" colors or sizes over health/temperament\n- Marketing \"Euro\" or \"European\" Great Danes that don't conform to the Great Dane breed standard\n- No involvement in dog shows, performance events, or breed clubs\n- Can't discuss pedigrees beyond one generation\n- Vague answers about feeding, training, or care recommendations\n- No other breeder references or professional relationships\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExcellent Breeder Green Flags\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n‚úÖ **Outstanding Signs:**\n- **Active in breed community** - Shows, clubs, education events\n- **Mentors other breeders** - Sharing knowledge indicates expertise\n- **Continuing education** - Attends seminars, reads research, evolves practices\n- **Transparent about challenges** - Honest about breed limitations and difficulties\n- **Long-term relationships** - Families who return for second dogs\n- **Professional references** - Veterinarians, other breeders, breed experts\n- **Detailed puppy records** - Weight charts, vaccination records, early observations\n- **Thoughtful breeding frequency** - Limited litters allow focus on quality\n\n‚úÖ **Bonus Points:**\n- Co-breeding relationships with established breeders\n- Participation in breed health studies or research\n- Multiple generations of their own breeding\n- Success in various venues (conformation, performance, therapy work)\n- Recognition from breed organizations or kennel clubs\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## What to Expect During Your Visit\n\nA visit to a quality breeder should feel like meeting potential family members, not shopping for merchandise.

Always ask your breeder to explain why something is missing rather than assuming it's a red flag. For example, some breeders work with dogs from other countries that have equivalent but different testing protocols, or they may be working with younger dogs that haven't yet reached the age for certain OFA testing requirements. A responsible breeder will be transparent about why documentation might be missing and what alternative testing or timing applies.\n\n**Red Flags in Health Testing:**\n\n‚ùå **Warning Signs:**\n- Refusal to provide documentation\n- \"The vet says they're healthy\" without specific testing\n- Testing performed by non-specialists\n- Claims that testing is \"unnecessary\" for their lines\n\n**Understanding Results:**\nNot every dog needs perfect scores, but you should understand:\n- How the breeder interprets and uses results\n- Why they chose to breed dogs with specific clearances\n- What the results mean for your puppy's future health\n- Whether both parents complement each other's strengths\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Building the Right Breeder Relationship\n\nThe best breeder-family relationships begin before you get your puppy and continue throughout your dog's life.

The 6.2% resulting COI gave us predictable temperaments and structure while maintaining genetic diversity.\n\n- **Second Litter - Concentrating Excellence:**  \n  For our second litter, we chose a more intensive approach. Sean carries a concentrated dose of the same exceptional bloodlines, particularly:\n  - Am Ch PRF Fendane Have I Gone Mad (Piper's own father)\n  - Am GCh Danemark's Diamond Cartier V Aldawn (appears multiple times)\n  - The same Tequila Mockingbird and Allie-Gator lines\n\n**Note:** COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding) values mentioned in this post are calculated from pedigrees and serve as a proxy for true genetic COI. Actual genetic diversity can only be determined through DNA testing, so pedigree-based COI should be interpreted as an estimate rather than an absolute measure.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## The Science Behind Our Strategy\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDetailed Breeding Analysis\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**Compounding Excellence: Shared Key Ancestors Between Both Litters**\n\n- Am Ch Saul's Tequila Mockingbird\n- Am GCh Fendanesylcrests See You Later Allie-Gator\n- Am Ch PRF Fendane Have I Gone Mad (Piper's father + in both sires)\n\nWhat this means:\n\nBoth litters are getting these same influential dogs from both parents.\nWe're essentially linebreeding on the same key ancestors in both litters.\nThe second litter intensifies these influences because Sean himself is more linebred on these same lines.\n\nThe pattern shows: Heavy reliance on Fendane/Fendanesylcrest bloodlines across our entire breeding program. While this can fix type and create consistency, it also explains why both litters have elevated COI despite our foundation bitch starting with 0.0%.\nThis is evidence of our breeding decisions: following a specific linebreeding strategy focused on these particular bloodlines, demonstrating the kind of careful genetic planning that responsible breeding requires.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow COI is Calculated: A Real Example Using Sean\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**Understanding Coefficient of Inbreeding Through Sean's Pedigree**\n\nThe coefficient of inbreeding (COI) quantifies the likelihood that an individual inherits two copies of the same region of DNA from a common ancestor. Odds are you are not one to break out equations to explicilty explain things, but calculating a COI from a pedigree is a right of passage for all dog nerds. In real life, nearly everyone uses software to make these calculations, but in case the power goes out or your internet fails, it is a good idea to at least have went through this exercise so we can rebuild knowledge if civilization ends, ha! Let's use our own Sean (22.7% COI) as a concrete example of how this calculation works.\n\n**Step-by-Step COI Calculation:**\n\n**1. Identify Common Ancestors**\nSean's COI comes from multiple dogs appearing on both his mother's and father's sides. Let's trace one example:\n\n**Am GCh Danemark's Diamond Cartier V Aldawn** appears twice in Sean's pedigree:\n- **Father's side:** Cartier is Sean's paternal grandfather (2 generations back)\n- **Mother's side:** Cartier appears as a maternal great-grandfather (3 generations back)\n\n**2. Calculate the Probability**\nUsing the formula: f = (1/2)^(n1 + n2 + 1) √ó (1 + F(A))\n\nWhere:\n- n1 = 2 (generations from father's side to Cartier)\n- n2 = 3 (generations from mother's side to Cartier)\n- F(A) = 0.0% (Cartier's own COI)\n\n**3. The Math**\nf = (1/2)^(2 + 3 + 1) √ó (1 + 0.0)\nf = (1/2)^6 √ó 1\nf = 1/64 = **1.56%**\n\n**4. Why Sean's Total COI is 22.7%**\nThis 1.56% represents just **one** common ancestor! Sean's COI comes from **multiple** shared ancestors:\n- Cartier appears through different paths\n- **NORDCH Diplomatic's Umberto di Visconti** appears multiple times\n- Several other Danemark dogs appear repeatedly\n\nThe 22.7% total represents the sum of ALL these individual contributions.\n\n**5. What This Means for Breeding**\nWhen we bred Sean to Piper (0.0% COI), we were using Sean's genetics from proven bloodlines while relying on Piper's outcross genetics to balance the linebreeding. This strategic approach gave us the 12.5% COI in their puppies‚Äîconcentrated enough to predict type and temperament, but moderated by Piper's (and Sean's) genetic diversity.\n\n**Important Note:** Pedigree-based COI calculations assume founder dogs are unrelated and serve as estimates. Genetic COI through DNA testing provides more accurate assessments by accounting for some of the actual genetic recombination.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Champion Bloodlines and Achievements\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnderstanding AKC Titles and Abbreviations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**Decoding the Letters: What Those Title Abbreviations Mean**\n\nWhen reading pedigrees, you'll see many abbreviated titles before and after a dog's name.

She dreamed of a \"different kind of club\"‚Äîone that offered education, community, and genuine relationships rather than just competition.\nThree years ago in 2022, my spouse Karen and I walked into our first Illini Great Dane Club meeting as curious newcomers. Today, we're deeply involved in a community that's taught us what responsible breeding and genuine mentorship look like. Here's our story of discovering what \"more than show and go\" really means, and why it matters for every family considering a Great Dane.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKey Takeaways\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n- The Illini Great Dane Club is built on education, mentorship, and community‚Äînot just competition.\n- Responsible breeders are deeply involved in ongoing learning and service, not just producing puppies.\n- Choosing a Great Dane from a breeder with this philosophy means joining a supportive, knowledgeable community.\n- The club's founders and members prioritize breed preservation, ethical breeding, and lifelong support for families.\n- Community events, educational programs, and mentorship are central to the club's mission.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## From Newcomers to Community Members\n\nIn just three years, my spouse Karen and I have gone from Outstanding New Members to leaders alongside many other dedicated volunteers in the Illini Great Dane Club‚Äîa journey that reflects the club's remarkable ability to nurture dedication and honor the enduring vision of its founders.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Recognition \u0026 Service Roles\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThe club has honored us with recognition that we see as opportunities to serve: the **2022 Outstanding New Member Award** along with the **AKC Title Award** for our first champion Piper, Karen's **2023 Outstanding Service Award**, and our **2024 Top Breeder**, **Breeder of AKC Title**, and **Puppy Class Blues - Bitch** awards. More importantly, the club has trusted us with leadership roles that let us give back to the community that welcomed us.\n\n**Our Service Journey:**\n- 2022-2025: Ways and Means Chairs (multiple years)\n- 2023-2024: Karen as Show Chair and Membership Chair, Dustin as co-chair (2024 show)\n- 2024: Dustin becomes Director + Public \u0026 Club Education Chair\n- 2024-2025: Dustin as Show Chair, Karen as co-chair (2025 show)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## What We've Learned About Community\n\nThe Illini Great Dane Club isn't just about showing dogs‚Äîit's about building relationships and learning together. When we first joined, we were amazed by how much education and mentorship happens here. The club's founder, Pat Lawrence, wanted something different from the typical \"show and go\" mentality, and that spirit is still alive today.\n\nAs charter member Jeff Lawrence recalled, \"Mom wanted them to have fun and to learn something also.\" That's exactly what we've experienced. From flea markets in borrowed buildings to entertaining skits that poked fun at different types of handlers and judges, the founding members understood that preserving the breed required more than passion‚Äîit needed community, education, and real commitment.\n\n## Education in Action\n\nAs Public \u0026 Club Education Chair, I've made it part of my mission to host programs that actually help people. We're not just talking theory‚Äîwe're tackling real challenges that Great Dane breeders and owners face today.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEducational Programs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n### Completed Educational Programs\n- **Genetic diversity and inherited disease risk** - addressing cutting-edge breeding science\n- **\"Berner University\" breed education program** - building fundamental knowledge\n- **Contracts as tools to avoid conflict and build trust** - practical ethics for breeders\n- **Great Dane Club of America's post-operative bleeding study** - sharing vital health research\n- **Interview with Bev Klingensmith** about her dog Bing, who starred in \"The Friend\" with Bill Murray and Naomi Watts\n\n### Upcoming Programs\n- **Fast CAT Introduction (July 15th)** - expanding opportunities beyond traditional conformation showing for Great Dane owners\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Learning by Doing\n\nKaren served as Show Chair for the 2023-2024 year, I served as her co-chair, and we learned a ton about what it takes to put on a successful event. As Karen told The Vedette newspaper, \"The best part of the event is the satisfaction of working with others that care deeply about the interests of Great Danes in a way that promotes the breed.\"\n\nThe following year, I served as Show Chair, while Karen served as co-chair. Our club dedicated the 2025 show to Jim Novotny's memory‚Äîa longtime member who exemplified the \"Spirit of Illini\" through mentorship and selfless service. Jim, a longtime Will County resident and 16-year member, served as board member, vice president, and president. He and his wife Pam received both the People's Choice Award and the prestigious Spirit of Illini Award. Through the years, Jim mentored many members and gave tremendous time and energy to the club's success. That spirit of mentorship and selfless service is what makes this community special.\n\nWhat we love about these shows is how they bring the community together. Local choirs perform the national anthem, high school students volunteer, and everyone gets to see what responsible dog ownership and breed preservation look like in action. These aren't just dog shows‚Äîthey're celebrations of community.\n\n\n## What This Means for Your Family\n\nFor families considering a Great Dane, this story matters because it shows what you're really choosing when you select a responsible breeder. You're not just getting a puppy‚Äîyou're joining a community with deep roots, ongoing education, and genuine care for every dog's future.\n\nWhen you choose a Great Dane from breeders who embrace this philosophy, you're not just getting excellent bloodlines. You're joining a network of mentorship, education, and support that spans generations. Our commitment to the Illini Great Dane Club's educational mission means we're always learning, always improving, and always available to help your Great Dane thrive throughout their life.\n\nThis is what \"more than show and go\" looks like in practice: breeders who view their role as lifelong stewards rather than simply producing puppies, and who are actively involved in advancing Great Dane health, education, and welfare through meaningful community service.\n\n## Understanding the Great Dane Heart\n\nAs Karen beautifully expressed, \"Great Danes are honest and true. Unlike other breeds, they can't hide behind a long coat or flashy attitude.\" This honesty in the show ring reflects a deeper truth about the breed's character.\n\nWhat truly makes Great Danes remarkable companions is their temperament despite their giant size, their unwavering loyalty to their families, and their nature that has earned them the title \"gentle giants.\" The relationship between humans and dogs spans 20,000-40,000 years, and Great Danes exemplify the qualities that have made this partnership endure: genuine devotion, protective instincts, and an intuitive understanding of their human families' needs.\n\nThe Illini Great Dane Club represents the modern expression of this bond: a community understanding that preserving our breed requires education, mentorship, and unwavering commitment to every Great Dane's welfare.\n\n## Honored to Be Stewards\n\nWhen families choose a Great Dane from breeders who embrace this philosophy, they become part of something larger than a breeding program‚Äîthey join a legacy that has valued education and relationships for over four decades, all within a community guided by mentors who represent the pinnacle of American Great Dane breeding excellence.\n\nThe Illini Great Dane Club is exceptional. The progression from new members in 2022 to our current leadership roles represents the club's remarkable ability to nurture growth while staying true to its founding values: promoting the quality of the purebred Great Dane, protecting and advancing the breed's interests, and encouraging good sportsmanship in competition.\n\nOur service roles‚Äîfrom show leadership to education programming‚Äîaren't achievements but opportunities to honor those who came before us while building bridges for those who will follow. We're committed to ensuring that the vision of being \"more than show and go\" continues to thrive for future generations of Great Dane enthusiasts and responsible breeders.\n\nTo learn more about our Great Danes and philosophy, visit [7Sisters Farm](/7Sisters).
