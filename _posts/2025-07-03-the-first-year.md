Watching a Great Dane puppy grow from a 1-2 pound newborn to a 100+ pound adult in just 12 months is one of nature's most remarkable transformations. Understanding what to expect during each stage helps families provide appropriate care, training, and nutrition while recognizing normal development from concerning changes.

This guide draws from our experience raising multiple litters, ongoing mentorship from accomplished breeders, and observations from families who've welcomed 7Sisters puppies into their homes. We'll cover physical development, behavioral milestones, training opportunities, and health considerations for each month of your Great Dane's crucial first year.

<details>
<summary><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></summary>

- Great Dane puppies grow rapidly—expect major changes every month in size, behavior, and needs.
- Growth plates may remain open until 18–24 months; avoid early spay/neuter and excessive exercise.
- Feed for slow, steady growth using large-breed-appropriate feed; overfeeding can cause orthopedic issues.
- Early socialization, training, and veterinary care are critical for a healthy, well-adjusted adult.
- Ongoing support from your breeder and a Dane-experienced vet is essential—don't hesitate to ask questions.

> **A Note Before You Begin:**  
> There's a wealth of information about Great Danes available online, and many experienced breeders, veterinarians, and experts have written about every aspect of Dane care in far greater detail. My goal here is to provide a practical, organized resource that brings together the basics in one place—so you can find answers quickly and learn a lot fast. Every puppy develops at their own pace, and the timelines in this guide represent typical development, but individual variation is normal. You must always consult a veterinarian who is knowledgeable about Great Danes regarding your specific puppy's growth and health needs, and confirm that your vet understands the unique requirements of this breed. Don't hesitate to seek out multiple sources, ask questions, and use your best judgment. What matters most is finding what works best for your individual dog and family.

<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: Birth to 2 Weeks (The Neonatal Period)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Birth weight:** 1-2 pounds (450-900 grams).
- **Eyes and ears closed**—puppies rely entirely on touch and smell.
- **Limited mobility**—mostly sleeping and nursing.
- **Umbilical cord detaches** around day 1-3.
- **Daily weight gain:** During the first week, puppies should gain about 10–15% of their birth weight per day. After the first week, steady daily weight gain is still important, but the percentage will gradually decrease as the puppy grows.

**Behavioral Milestones:**
- **Rooting reflex**—automatically seeks mother's milk.
- **Sleep 90% of the time**—only waking to nurse.
- **Temperature regulation**—relies entirely on mother and littermates.
- **Basic reflexes present**—withdrawal from pain, startle response.

**What We Do During This Period:**
At 7Sisters, we perform Early Neurological Stimulation (ENS) from days 3-16, which involves brief, gentle handling exercises designed to produce neurological stimulations that wouldn't occur naturally during this early period. We also begin weighing puppies daily to ensure proper growth rates.

**For Breeders—Critical Care Points:**
- Monitor weight gain religiously—any puppy losing weight needs immediate attention.
- Maintain whelping box temperature at 85-90°F for first week.
- Minimal handling except for health checks and ENS protocols.
- Watch for signs of fading puppy syndrome.

<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 2-3 Weeks (The Transitional Period)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Eyes begin opening** around day 10-14, fully open by day 21.
- **Ears start opening** around day 13-17.
- **Weight typically doubles** from birth weight.
- **First teeth appear**—baby teeth start erupting.
- **More coordinated movement**—can stand and walk shakily.

**Behavioral Milestones:**
- **First responses to sound** once ears open.
- **Beginning social interaction** with littermates.
- **Startle response** to loud noises develops.
- **Elimination control begins**—can urinate/defecate without mother's stimulation.
- **Tail wagging** starts appearing.

**Early Development Activities:**
- **Gentle handling** to accustom puppies to human touch.
- **Introduction of new textures**—different blankets, surfaces.
- **Soft sounds**—talking, gentle music to begin sound socialization.

**Important Notes:**
This is a critical period for neurological development. We continue ENS until day 16, then begin more varied handling and gentle stimulation. Puppies are still nursing exclusively but beginning to show interest in their environment.

<details>
<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 3-5 Weeks (The Awareness Period)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Weight:** Typically 4-8 pounds by week 4.
- **Coordination improves dramatically**—running and playing begins.
- **Full sight and hearing**—can respond to sights and sounds.
- **Baby teeth fully erupted**—28 temporary teeth.
- **Temperature regulation develops**—less dependent on external warmth.

**Behavioral Milestones:**
- **Play behavior emerges**—wrestling with littermates.
- **Fear responses develop**—can be startled by new experiences.
- **Learning to communicate**—different barks and vocalizations.
- **Curiosity about environment**—investigating new objects.
- **Beginning pack behavior**—hierarchy starts forming in litter.

**Training and Socialization Opportunities:**
- **Early noise exposure**—vacuum cleaners, TV sounds, kitchen noises.
- **Gentle handling**—touching paws, ears, mouth for future grooming.
- **Introduction to different people**—various ages, voices, appearances.
- **Basic surface exposure**—grass, concrete, different textures.

**Feeding Changes:**
Around week 4, we begin introducing gruel (high-quality feed soaked in warm water) alongside continued nursing. Puppies may play in their food more than eat it initially—this is normal exploration behavior.

**What Families Should Know:**
If you're visiting puppies during this period, they're becoming more interactive but still tire easily. Their personalities are just beginning to emerge, and they may show fear responses to new experiences for the first time.

<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 5-8 Weeks (The Primary Socialization Period)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Weight:** 8-15 pounds by week 6, 12-20 pounds by week 8.
- **Rapid growth phase begins**—dramatic size increases weekly.
- **Motor skills refined**—coordinated running, jumping, playing.
- **Eyes change color**—from blue to adult color for most puppies.
- **Muscle coordination improves**—better balance and agility.

**Behavioral Milestones:**
- **Peak learning period**—easiest time to introduce new experiences; puppies are highly receptive to new sights, sounds, and people.
- **Bite inhibition learned** from littermates and mother—puppies learn to control the strength of their bite through play.
- **House training awareness**—can begin to understand clean/dirty areas, especially with consistent routines.
- **Attention span increases**—can focus on activities for longer periods, making short training sessions more effective.
- **Attachment behavior**—beginning to bond with specific people; puppies may show preference for certain family members.

**Critical Socialization Windows:**
- **Human handling**—expose puppies to different family members, including gentle children, to build trust and confidence.
- **Sound desensitization**—introduce household noises, car sounds, and outdoor environments to reduce future fear responses.
- **Surface variety**—let puppies explore stairs, ramps, and different flooring materials to build confidence and coordination.
- **Other animals**—carefully introduce to cats and older dogs (with vaccinations in mind) to encourage positive interspecies interactions.
- **Basic experiences**—practice collar wearing, gentle restraint, and grooming tools to prepare for future care.

**Training Foundations:**
- **Tonal responses**—puppies respond to familiar voices and tones; use positive reinforcement.
- **Come when called**—practice short distances in safe areas.
- **Sit**—many puppies can learn the basic sit command at this age.
- **Gentle leash introduction**—wearing a collar for short periods and gentle leash handling.

**Feeding and Growth:**
- Puppies are fully weaned by 6-7 weeks and eating solid food 3-4 times daily.
- Feed a high-quality dog food to support proper growth rates.
- Always consult your veterinarian before making major diet changes.
- Rapid growth requires careful nutrition management—too much or too little can cause developmental problems.

**Health Considerations:**
- **First vaccinations** typically start at 6-8 weeks (consult your veterinarian for the best schedule).
- **Parasite screening** and treatment if needed.
- **Growth monitoring**—ensure steady but not excessive weight gain.
- **Joint development**—avoid excessive exercise that could damage growing bones.

**For New Families:**
- Puppies may be ready to go to their new homes around 8 weeks. This is an ideal time for bonding and beginning house training, but remember they have limited bladder control and need frequent potty breaks.
- This is a critical window for socialization—expose your puppy to as many positive experiences as possible, always prioritizing safety and gentle handling.

<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 8-12 Weeks (Leaving Home and Adjustment)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Weight:** 20-35 pounds by week 12.
- **Growth rate:** Gaining 2-5 pounds per week.
- **Adult proportions emerging**—legs getting longer, body stretching.
- **Baby teeth present**—permanent teeth will begin erupting around 3.5 to 4 months.
- **Coordination continues improving**—can navigate stairs with supervision.

**Behavioral Milestones:**
- **Separation anxiety possible**—adjusting to new home without littermates.
- **Bonding intensifies**—puppy may choose primary family members.
- **Confidence building**—exploring new environments with encouragement.
- **Sleep patterns changing**—sleeping through night becomes possible.
- **Attention span improving**—can focus on training for 5-10 minutes.

**Training Priorities:**
- **House training intensive period**—most important skill to establish; expect accidents and be consistent.
- **Basic commands**—sit, stay, come, down.
- **Crate training**—positive association with confined space.
- **Leash walking**—beginning loose leash behavior.
- **Bite inhibition**—redirect puppy biting to appropriate toys.

**Socialization Continues:**
- **Puppy classes**—learning to focus around distractions.
- **Public outings**—hardware stores, pet-friendly businesses.
- **Different environments**—parks, beaches, urban settings.
- **Various people**—children, elderly, people with equipment (wheelchairs, canes).
- **Other animals**—continued exposure to cats, other dog breeds.

**Feeding and Nutrition:**
- Three meals daily of high-quality dog feed formulated specifically for large or giant breeds. Avoid most standard puppy foods, as they are often too high in protein and calcium for Great Danes and can contribute to developmental orthopedic problems. Measure portions carefully—Great Dane puppies should maintain a lean body condition during growth. Overfeeding can also cause developmental issues.
- Always consult your veterinarian before making major diet changes.
- Measure portions carefully—Great Dane puppies should maintain lean body condition during growth.
- Overfeeding can cause developmental orthopedic problems.

**Common Challenges:**
- **Accidents in house**—completely normal, maintain consistency.
- **Destructive chewing**—provide appropriate outlets and redirect.
- **Jumping on people**—begin teaching "four on the floor" immediately.
- **Mouthing/biting**—redirect to toys, never encourage rough play.
- **Sleep disruption**—adjustment period to new schedule and environment.

**Health and Veterinary Care:**
- **Vaccination series**—DHPP, and in the U.S., the first rabies vaccine is usually given at 12-16 weeks (not before 12 weeks).
- **Parasite prevention**—monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention.
- **Growth monitoring**—vet should track weight and development.
- **Spay/neuter discussion**—for giant breeds like Great Danes, discuss with your vet about delaying spay/neuter until after 18-24 months to support healthy growth and joint development.

<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 6-9 Months (The Adolescent Phase)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Weight:** 70-90 pounds by 9 months
- **Height:** 26-30 inches at the shoulder
- **Sexual maturity**—While some females may have their first heat as early as 9-12 months, most Great Danes experience their first heat between 12-18 months, and some as late as 18-24 months. Males may begin showing interest in females, but full sexual maturity is often later in giant breeds.
- **Growth rate slowing**—still growing but less dramatically
- **Adult coat developing**—texture and color may change

> **Note on Giant Breed Maturity:**
> Great Danes and other giant breeds tend to mature later than smaller dogs. While a Chihuahua might have her first heat at 6-8 months, Great Danes usually take longer to reach sexual maturity. Genetics, nutrition, health status, individual development, and even season can all influence timing. Most families should expect a first heat closer to the dog's first birthday or beyond, but earlier or later is also normal.
>
> **Why this matters:** The timing of sexual maturity affects spay decisions. Many veterinarians now recommend waiting until after the first heat for giant breeds to allow for proper bone and joint development.

**Behavioral Intensity:**
- **Maximum testing phase**—pushing every boundary possible
- **Confidence peaks**—may become overly bold or assertive
- **Attention seeking increases**—dramatic behaviors to get responses
- **Selective memory**—"forgetting" house rules when convenient
- **Peer pressure**—more interested in other dogs than human direction

**Training Persistence:**
- **Don't give up**—this is when many families lose consistency; stick with your training routines
- **Professional help**—consider working with an experienced trainer if challenges arise
- **Group classes valuable**—learning to work around major distractions
- **Practice in new places**—ensuring commands work everywhere, not just at home
- **Emergency recall**—perfecting the come command for safety

**Exercise Requirements:**
- **Significant needs**—under-exercised adolescents are destructive adolescents
- **Mental challenges**—puzzle feeders, training games, exploration
- **Appropriate outlets**—activities that satisfy natural behaviors (chewing, digging, chasing)
- **Supervised freedom**—secured yards or long lines for running
- **Structured activities**—hiking, swimming, organized play

**Social Dynamics:**
- **Dog park caution**—we do not recommended to take adolescent Great Danes to dog parks, as other dogs are unpredictable and the environment can be unsafe for young, developing Danes. Instead, arrange controlled playdates with known, well-mannered dogs for safer socialization.
- **Size awareness**—learning they can't play with small dogs like littermates
- **Human interaction**—may jump, mouth, or otherwise be inappropriate
- **Territorial behavior**—may begin guarding home or family
- **Same-sex conflicts**—particularly intact males may have issues

**Common Crisis Points:**
- **Destructive behavior**—chewing furniture, digging, general mayhem
- **Aggression emergence**—resource guarding, dominance, fear-based reactions
- **Escape attempts**—fence jumping, door dashing, general Houdini behavior
- **House training failures**—marking, accidents, refusing to go outside
- **Excessive vocalization**—barking, howling, demand vocalizations

<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 9-12 Months (Maturing Toward Adulthood)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Weight:** 90-120+ pounds by 12 months (varies significantly by sex and lines)
- **Height:** 28-32+ inches at shoulder
- **Near adult size**—80-90% of mature size achieved
- **Sexual maturity complete**—must mitigate risk of premature reproduction (closely supervise intact dogs and discuss timing of spay/neuter with your vet)
- **Growth plates closing**—some may close by 12 months, others continue growing
- Even though your Dane is nearly full size, growth plates may not be fully closed—avoid high-impact activities until your veterinarian confirms it’s safe.

**First Heat Cycle Timing (Females):**
- **Most common:** 12–18 months
- **Early side:** 9–12 months (less common but normal)
- **Later side:** 18–24 months (also normal)

**Behavioral Settling:**
- **Gradual maturation**—testing behaviors begin to decrease
- **Increased focus**—attention span improving, more biddable
- **Confidence stabilizing**—less erratic behavior, more predictable responses
- **Relationship solidifying**—stronger bonds with family members
- **Routine appreciation**—beginning to value structure and predictability

**Training Breakthroughs:**
- **Reliability increasing**—commands work more consistently
- **Complex learning**—can handle multi-step tasks and advanced training
- **Better impulse control**—can wait longer, handle frustration better
- **Environmental stability**—less reactive to new situations
- **Work ethic developing**—beginning to enjoy training and challenges

**Exercise Maturation:**
- **Adult activity levels**—establishing long-term exercise patterns
- **Joint consideration**—growth plates may still be developing
- **Endurance building**—can handle longer activities gradually
- **Mental stimulation**—continuing need for cognitive challenges
- **Preferred activities**—individual preferences becoming clear

**Health Transitions:**
- **Annual health planning**—establishing adult healthcare routine
- **Preventive care**—dental hygiene, weight management, joint health
- **Behavioral stability**—personality solidifying, fewer dramatic changes

**Family Integration:**
By 12 months, your Great Dane should be a genuine family member who understands house rules, has reliable house training, and demonstrates the gentle giant temperament for which the breed is famous. While they may continue growing slightly and maturing behaviorally until 18-24 months, the foundation for your life together is well established.
