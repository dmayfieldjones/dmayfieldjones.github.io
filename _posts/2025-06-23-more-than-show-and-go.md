When Pat Lawrence gathered friends around her kitchen table in 1982, she may have had no idea her vision would still be shaping Great Dane breeders four decades later. She dreamed of a "different kind of club"—one that offered education, community, and genuine relationships rather than just competition.
Three years ago in 2022, my spouse Karen and I walked into our first Illini Great Dane Club meeting as curious newcomers. Today, we're deeply involved in a community that's taught us what responsible breeding and genuine mentorship look like. Here's our story of discovering what "more than show and go" really means, and why it matters for every family considering a Great Dane.

## What We've Learned About Community

The Illini Great Dane Club isn't just about showing dogs—it's about building relationships and learning together. When we first joined, we were amazed by how much education and mentorship happens here. The club's founder, Pat Lawrence, wanted something different from the typical "show and go" mentality, and that spirit is still alive today.

As charter member Jeff Lawrence recalled, "Mom wanted them to have fun and to learn something also." That's exactly what we've experienced. From flea markets in borrowed buildings to entertaining skits that poked fun at different types of handlers and judges, the founding members understood that preserving the breed required more than passion—it needed community, education, and real commitment.

## Education in Action

As Public & Club Education Chair, I've made it part of my mission to host programs that actually help people. We're not just talking theory—we're tackling real challenges that Great Dane breeders and owners face today.

## Learning by Doing

Karen served as Show Chair for the 2023-2024 year, I served as her co-chair, and we learned a ton about what it takes to put on a successful event. As Karen told The Vedette newspaper, "The best part of the event is the satisfaction of working with others that care deeply about the interests of Great Danes in a way that promotes the breed."

The following year, I served as Show Chair, while Karen served as co-chair. Our club dedicated the 2025 show to Jim Novotny's memory—a longtime member who exemplified the "Spirit of Illini" through mentorship and selfless service. Jim, a longtime Will County resident and 16-year member, served as board member, vice president, and president. He and his wife Pam received both the People's Choice Award and the prestigious Spirit of Illini Award. Through the years, Jim mentored many members and gave tremendous time and energy to the club's success. That spirit of mentorship and selfless service is what makes this community special.

What we love about these shows is how they bring the community together. Local choirs perform the national anthem, high school students volunteer, and everyone gets to see what responsible dog ownership and breed preservation look like in action. These aren't just dog shows—they're celebrations of community.


## What This Means for Your Family

For families considering a Great Dane, this story matters because it shows what you're really choosing when you select a responsible breeder. You're not just getting a puppy—you're joining a community with deep roots, ongoing education, and genuine care for every dog's future.

When you choose a Great Dane from breeders who embrace this philosophy, you're not just getting excellent bloodlines. You're joining a network of mentorship, education, and support that spans generations. Our commitment to the Illini Great Dane Club's educational mission means we're always learning, always improving, and always available to help your Great Dane thrive throughout their life.

This is what "more than show and go" looks like in practice: breeders who view their role as lifelong stewards rather than simply producing puppies, and who are actively involved in advancing Great Dane health, education, and welfare through meaningful community service.

## Understanding the Great Dane Heart

As Karen beautifully expressed, "Great Danes are honest and true. Unlike other breeds, they can't hide behind a long coat or flashy attitude." This honesty in the show ring reflects a deeper truth about the breed's character.

What truly makes Great Danes remarkable companions is their temperament despite their giant size, their unwavering loyalty to their families, and their nature that has earned them the title "gentle giants." The relationship between humans and dogs spans 20,000-40,000 years, and Great Danes exemplify the qualities that have made this partnership endure: genuine devotion, protective instincts, and an intuitive understanding of their human families' needs.

The Illini Great Dane Club represents the modern expression of this bond: a community understanding that preserving our breed requires education, mentorship, and unwavering commitment to every Great Dane's welfare.

## Honored to Be Stewards

When families choose a Great Dane from breeders who embrace this philosophy, they become part of something larger than a breeding program—they join a legacy that has valued education and relationships for over four decades, all within a community guided by mentors who represent the pinnacle of American Great Dane breeding excellence.

The Illini Great Dane Club is exceptional. The progression from new members in 2022 to our current leadership roles represents the club's remarkable ability to nurture growth while staying true to its founding values: promoting the quality of the purebred Great Dane, protecting and advancing the breed's interests, and encouraging good sportsmanship in competition.

Our service roles—from show leadership to education programming—aren't achievements but opportunities to honor those who came before us while building bridges for those who will follow. We're committed to ensuring that the vision of being "more than show and go" continues to thrive for future generations of Great Dane enthusiasts and responsible breeders.
