Finding the right Great Dane breeder isn't just about finding a puppy‚Äîyou're choosing a lifelong partner in your dog's health, temperament, and future. With so many breeders claiming to be "responsible," how do you identify those who truly prioritize your family's needs and the breed's welfare?

This guide draws from our experience in the Great Dane community and the lessons we've learned about what separates exceptional breeders from the rest. Whether you're a first-time Great Dane owner or adding to your pack, these questions will help you make an informed choice.

**Before You Start:** This guide assumes you've already decided on a Great Dane and understand the breed's basic requirements. If you want to understand what drives us at 7Sisters, start with our post ["More Than Show and Go: Our Journey into the Illini Great Dane Club"](/posts/2025-06-23-more-than-show-and-go) to see how community and relationships shape responsible breeding.

<details>
<summary><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></summary>

- Choosing the right breeder is as important as choosing the right puppy‚Äîlook for transparency, health testing, and mentorship.
- Ask about breeding philosophy, health clearances, socialization, and ongoing support.
- Red flags: always having puppies available, lack of health documentation, unwillingness to let you visit, or no involvement in the breed community.
- Excellent breeders offer lifetime support, clear contracts, and are active in breed education and health studies.
- Use the provided checklists and questions to evaluate breeders and make an informed decision.

## Before You Start Your Search

The best time to find a breeder is before you're emotionally attached to the idea of "getting a puppy soon." Great breeders often have waiting lists, and the best matches come from thoughtful planning, not impulse decisions. As a breeder, I think of myself as matching families with potential: the potential puppy that will become an amazing dog. It is part of the reason our website is not covered with pictures of cute puppies, but rather healthy, sound dogs that demonstrate our committment to producing excellent dogs.

<details>
<summary><strong>Setting Realistic Expectations</strong></summary>

**Timeline Reality:**
- Quality breeders typically have 6-18 month waiting lists
- The best breeders often breed only 1-2 litters per year
- Puppy selection usually happens at 6-8 weeks old
- Ideally, plan to visit the breeder in person or at least virtually, before taking your puppy home

**Investment Understanding:**
- Quality Great Dane puppies typically cost $2,000-$4,000+
- Health testing adds significant costs that responsible breeders absorb
- Often, show-quality dogs command premium prices (We have a flat fee because we put the same love and consideration into all of our dogs)
- The most expensive puppy isn't always the best choice for your family

**What You Should Know About Yourself:**
- Your experience level with large dogs (For me, Great Danes fall into exotic animals as much as dogs due to their unique requiremnts)
- Your activity level and exercise commitments
- Your preferences for male vs. female (size differences are significant)
- Whether you're interested in showing, performance events, or just companionship

## Essential Questions for Every Breeder

These questions will quickly separate serious breeders from puppy mills or backyard breeders. Pay attention not just to their answers, but to their enthusiasm for discussing these topics.

<details>
<summary><strong>About Their Breeding Program</strong></summary>

**The Right Questions to Ask:**

**"Can you explain your breeding philosophy and strategy?"**

‚úÖ **Good Answer:** They should articulate specific goals like temperament, health, or structure improvements. They might mention linebreeding strategies, outcrossing decisions, or working toward breed standards. Quality breeders can discuss their long-term goals spanning multiple generations.

‚ùå **Red Flag:** "We just breed our pets" or vague answers about "producing healthy puppies" without specifics.

**"Why did you choose this specific pairing?"**

‚úÖ **Good Answer:** They should discuss how the sire and dam complement each other's strengths and offset weaknesses. Quality breeders can explain concepts like coefficient of inbreeding (COI), discuss pedigree analysis, and explain expected outcomes. For deeper insight into this process, see our post ["Laying the Foundation: Science, Mentorship, and Our First 7Sisters Litters"](/posts/2025-06-23-laying-the-foundation) where we detail our progressive breeding strategy.

‚ùå **Red Flag:** "She was in season" or "We liked both dogs" without deeper genetic planning.

**"Who are your mentors in the breed?"**

‚úÖ **Good Answer:** They should name specific, accomplished breeders who guide their decisions. Quality breeders often co-breed with mentors, attend breed education events, and stay connected to breed clubs.

‚ùå **Red Flag:** No mentors, or they claim to be entirely self-taught.

**"What health testing do you perform?"**

‚úÖ **Good Answer:** At minimum: cardiac clearance, thyroid testing, and hip evaluation and eye testing. Advanced breeders may discuss genetic testing, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) screening, and breed-specific concerns. They should provide copies of all health clearances.

‚ùå **Red Flag:** "The vet says they're healthy" without specific testing, or refusal to provide documentation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>About Their Puppies & Practices</strong></summary>

**Understanding Their Puppy Program:**

**"How do you socialize your puppies?"**

‚úÖ **Good Answer:** Detailed socialization protocols starting around 3 weeks, exposure to various sounds/surfaces/people, early neurological stimulation (ENS), and structured puppy curriculum. They should welcome families visiting to help socialize puppies.

**"How do you match puppies to families?"**

‚úÖ **Good Answer:** Temperament testing, lifestyle questionnaires, ongoing communication about family needs, and prioritizing best fit over "first come, first served." Quality breeders often maintain some control over puppy placement.

**"What ongoing support do you provide?"**

‚úÖ **Good Answer:** Lifetime support for questions, willingness to take dogs back if needed, regular check-ins, feeding/training guidance, and connections to other puppy families. Many maintain private Facebook groups for ongoing community.

**"What contracts and guarantees do you offer?"**

‚úÖ **Good Answer:** Written contracts covering health guarantees, spay/neuter requirements for pet puppies, return policies, and clear expectations for both parties. They should explain why contracts protect both families and dogs.

## What to Expect During Your Visit

A visit to a quality breeder should feel like meeting potential family members, not shopping for merchandise. Here's what to observe and ask for during your visit.

<details>
<summary><strong>Evaluating the Environment</strong></summary>

**What You Should See:**

**Clean, Safe Facilities:**
- Dogs should be clean, well-groomed, and healthy-looking
- Living areas should be spacious, clean, and well-maintained
- Multiple areas for exercise, play, and rest
- Safe fencing and appropriate housing for the climate

**Puppy Areas:**
- Clean whelping areas with appropriate temperature control
- Age-appropriate toys and enrichment
- Evidence of early socialization (various surfaces, sounds)
- Puppies should be alert, playful, and healthy-looking

**Questions During Your Visit:**
- "Can you show me the health clearances for both parents?"
- "What does a typical day look like for the puppies?"
- "How do you handle puppy selection and matching?"
- "What happens if this puppy doesn't work out for our family?"
- "Can we meet some families who've gotten puppies from you?"

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Meeting the Parents & Puppies</strong></summary>

</details>

## Understanding Health Testing

Health testing is non-negotiable, but understanding what tests matter and how to interpret results will help you make better decisions.

<details>
<summary><strong>Essential Health Clearances for Great Danes</strong></summary>

**Required Testing:**

**Cardiac Clearance:**
- Cardiac evaluation by a veterinary cardiologist
- Look for OFA Cardiac clearance or equivalent
- Critical due to Great Dane susceptibility to heart conditions

**Hip Evaluation:**
- OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) certification preferred
- PennHIP evaluation is also acceptable
- Look for "Fair" or better ratings
- Both parents should be evaluated after 24 months of age

**Thyroid Testing:**
- Complete thyroid panel including autoantibodies
- OFA thyroid clearance preferred
- Should be normal or acceptable
- Important for long-term health and temperament

**Eye Clearance:**
- CERF (Canine Eye Registration Foundation) exam
- Performed by veterinary ophthalmologist
- Clear of hereditary eye diseases

**Advanced Testing:**
Progressive breeders may also perform:
- Genetic testing for known mutations
- DCM (Dilated Cardiomyopathy) screening protocols
- Stomach tacking recommendations
- Additional breed-specific testing

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to Verify Health Testing</strong></summary>

**Documentation You Should Receive:**
- Copies of all health clearances for both parents
- OFA certification numbers you can verify online
- Veterinary reports from testing
- Pedigree information showing health testing on ancestors

**Important Note About Missing Documentation:**
If any health testing documentation is missing, there may be valid reasons. Always ask your breeder to explain why something is missing rather than assuming it's a red flag. For example, some breeders work with dogs from other countries that have equivalent but different testing protocols, or they may be working with younger dogs that haven't yet reached the age for certain OFA testing requirements. A responsible breeder will be transparent about why documentation might be missing and what alternative testing or timing applies.

**Red Flags in Health Testing:**

‚ùå **Warning Signs:**
- Refusal to provide documentation
- "The vet says they're healthy" without specific testing
- Testing performed by non-specialists
- Claims that testing is "unnecessary" for their lines

**Understanding Results:**
Not every dog needs perfect scores, but you should understand:
- How the breeder interprets and uses results
- Why they chose to breed dogs with specific clearances
- What the results mean for your puppy's future health
- Whether both parents complement each other's strengths

</details>

## Building the Right Breeder Relationship

The best breeder-family relationships begin before you get your puppy and continue throughout your dog's life. Here's how to foster that partnership.
