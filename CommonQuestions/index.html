<FONT COLOR="#bf141c">When can we take our puppy home?</FONT>
<br>
You may receive your dog 8 weeks after their birth with an understanding that they are transitioning through a critical stage of development in which exposure to fear can 
have longer lasting effects on behavior. Interestingly, this impact/fear period is well recognized among breeders but appears absent from scientific literature. Consideration 
for potential traumatic events should be considered at this time, i.g. cropping, unsympathetic discipline, and even challenging transport.
<p></p>
<FONT COLOR="#bf141c">What value does our purchase include?</FONT>
<br>
Lifetime breeder support and education on the litter (i.g. health testing, pedigree, and our reasoning for parental selection), modified Puppy Culture socialization and training, age-appropriate vaccines, 
deworming, vet exams, health guarantee, microchipping and importantly microchip 
registration (<a href="https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/235/2/javma.235.2.160.xml">greater than 40%</a> of microchipped dogs have 
  been found to not be registered), AKC registration (to ensure it is done correctly and timely), introduction to crate-leash-potty training, and ear cropping if desired.<br>

  <p></p>
  <FONT COLOR="#bf141c">Why are your contracts customized?</FONT>
  <br>
We believe our customized contracts initiate important conversation with our clients and help ensure the safety and health of the dogs we whelp. 
We expect potential owners to feel welcome to ask questions and be a participant in actively negotiating contracts. 
<p></p>
<FONT COLOR="#bf141c">What feed and how much?</FONT>
<br>
We value healthy, affordable, safe, and convenient feed for your dog. We argue there is no feed specific to a particular breed. 
However, Great Dane puppies should not be fed many feeds labeled for puppies because they contain excessively high concentrations of protein and fat. 
Rehydrating a quality dry kibble and supporting your dog with a variety of healthy foods (less than 10% by weight of their diet) will meet the needs of most dogs and satisfy dog lovers. 
A fresh, or raw, diet can also provide exceptional nutrition for your dog.
<p></p>
<FONT COLOR="#bf141c">Why and how do you crop?</FONT>
<br>
We believe the minimally invasive surgery on, and following months of maintenance for, dogs that are cropped is a benign custom that appeals to 
aesthetic and traditional values shared by many dog lovers. Ear cropping continues to be a largely aesthetic choice. We find arguments in favor 
of cropping because of health and/or the natural upright ears of undomesticated canids unconvincing. Equally unconvincing are arguments discouraging
 cropping due to a suggested reduced ability to communicate, comparisons to amputation or mutilation, and veterinary professionals claiming the 
 procedure non-medically necessary or lacking a scientific justification. Undeniably, cropping is legally prohibited throughout many regions of 
 the world, and the condemning and illegalization of cropping has had historical impacts on the breeding and popularity of Great Danes. There are no 
 documented widespread changes in health or behavior due to cropping. There is no evidence for elevated cortisol levels after the wounds have healed 
 in 7-10 days. We believe from personal experience that it is no more traumatic than a pierced ear or a scratched knee in which the wound similarly 
 takes a few days to heal. It may be sore and itch, and we treat these symptoms.  Posting the ear is not painful and much more frustrating and 
 worrisome to the human than the dog. Therefore, we strongly advocate for and defend the choice of dog lovers and veterinarians to continue to crop 
 their dogs as an extension of supporting the historical preservation and aesthetic of the Great Dane breed Standard, and larger breed concept. It 
 is a beautiful thing.
 <br>
We choose and endorse Dr. Anne Midgarden DVM (Ohio) to crop our Great Dane puppies for our clients. We present clients with a modified care guide 
for educational purposes only. Cropping considerations and care should be made with the guidance of your veterinarian and breeders.

<FONT COLOR="#bf141c">Do you breed Euro-lines of Great Danes?</FONT>
<br>

We follow the current <a href="https://gdca.org/wp-content/uploads/TheGreatDane/2021-GDCA-Illustrated-Standard-10_19_21.pdf">standard</a> as approved 
by the Great Dane Club of America and the American Kennel Club. 
How this standard has evolved and how previous conformation points were awarded is fascinating and telling of our breed. 
The traits associated with Euro-lines, sometimes called hyper-exaggerated features, are outside our standard, and others: 
<a href="https://www.ukcdogs.com/docs/breeds/great-dane.pdf">UKC</a>, 
<a href="https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/breed-standards/working/great-dane/#:~:text=General%20appearance,grace%20of%20form%20most%20essential.">KC</a>, and
<a href="https://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/235g02-en.pdf">FCI</a>.
We are happy to discuss individual features with curious potential clients.
