<FONT COLOR="#bf141c">When can we take our puppy home?</FONT>
<br>
You may receive your dog 8 weeks after their birth with an understanding that they are transitioning through a critical stage of development in which exposure to fear can 
have longer lasting effects on behavior. Interestingly, this impact/fear period is well recognized among breeders but appears absent from scientific literature. Consideration 
for potential traumatic events should be considered at this time, i.g. cropping, unsympathetic discipline, and even challenging transport.
<p></p>
<FONT COLOR="#bf141c">What value does our purchase include?</FONT>
<br>
Lifetime breeder support and education on the litter (i.g. health testing, pedigree, and our reasoning for parental selection), modified Puppy Culture socialization and training, age-appropriate vaccines, 
deworming, vet exams, microchipping and importantly microchip registration <a href=”https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/235/2/javma.235.2.160.xml/”>(greater than 40% of microchipped dogs have
  been found to not be registered)</a>, AKC registration (to ensure it is done correctly and timely), introduction to crate-leash-potty training, and ear cropping if desired.<br>

  <p></p>
  <FONT COLOR="#bf141c">Why are your contracts customized?</FONT>
  <br>
We believe our customized contracts initiate important conversation with our clients and help ensure the safety and health of the dogs we whelp. 
We expect potential owners to feel welcome to ask questions and be a participant in actively negotiating contracts. 
<p></p>
<FONT COLOR="#bf141c">What feed and how much?</FONT>
<br>
We value healthy, affordable, safe, and convenient feed for your dog. We argue there is no feed specific to a particular breed. 
However, Great Dane puppies should not be fed many feeds labeled for puppies because they contain excessively high concentrations of protein and fat. 
Rehydrating a quality dry kibble and supporting your dog with a variety of healthy foods (less than 10% by weight of their diet) will meet the needs of most dogs and satisfy dog lovers. 
A fresh, or raw, diet can also provide exceptional nutrition for your dog.
