## Blog Post 1: "More Than Show and Go: Our Journey into the Illini Great Dane Club"
**Date:** 2025-06-23

When Pat Lawrence gathered friends around her kitchen table in 1982, she may have had no idea her vision would still be shaping Great Dane breeders four decades later. She dreamed of a "different kind of club"—one that offered education, community, and genuine relationships rather than just competition.
Three years ago in 2022, my spouse Karen and I walked into our first Illini Great Dane Club meeting as curious newcomers. Today, we're deeply involved in a community that's taught us what responsible breeding and genuine mentorship look like. Here's our story of discovering what "more than show and go" really means, and why it matters for every family considering a Great Dane.

## From Newcomers to Community Members

In just three years, my spouse Karen and I have gone from Outstanding New Members to leaders alongside many other dedicated volunteers in the Illini Great Dane Club—a journey that reflects the club's remarkable ability to nurture dedication and honor the enduring vision of its founders.

### Our Recognition & Service Roles

The club has honored us with recognition that we see as opportunities to serve: the **2022 Outstanding New Member Award** along with the **AKC Title Award** for our first champion Piper, Karen's **2023 Outstanding Service Award**, and our **2024 Top Breeder**, **Breeder of AKC Title**, and **Puppy Class Blues - Bitch** awards. More importantly, the club has trusted us with leadership roles that let us give back to the community that welcomed us.

**Our Service Journey:**
- 2022-2025: Ways and Means Chairs (multiple years)
- 2023-2024: Karen as Show Chair and Membership Chair, Dustin as co-chair (2024 show)
- 2024: Dustin becomes Director + Public & Club Education Chair
- 2024-2025: Dustin as Show Chair, Karen as co-chair (2025 show)

## What We've Learned About Community

The Illini Great Dane Club isn't just about showing dogs—it's about building relationships and learning together. When we first joined, we were amazed by how much education and mentorship happens here. The club's founder, Pat Lawrence, wanted something different from the typical "show and go" mentality, and that spirit is still alive today.

As charter member Jeff Lawrence recalled, "Mom wanted them to have fun and to learn something also." That's exactly what we've experienced. From flea markets in borrowed buildings to entertaining skits that poked fun at different types of handlers and judges, the founding members understood that preserving the breed required more than passion—it needed community, education, and real commitment.

## Education in Action

As Public & Club Education Chair, I've made it part of my mission to host programs that actually help people. We're not just talking theory—we're tackling real challenges that Great Dane breeders and owners face today.

### Completed Educational Programs
- **Genetic diversity and inherited disease risk** - addressing cutting-edge breeding science
- **"Berner University" breed education program** - building fundamental knowledge
- **Contracts as tools to avoid conflict and build trust** - practical ethics for breeders
- **Great Dane Club of America's post-operative bleeding study** - sharing vital health research
- **Interview with Bev Klingensmith** about her dog Bing, who starred in "The Friend" with Bill Murray and Naomi Watts

### Upcoming Programs
- **Fast CAT Introduction (July 15th)** - expanding opportunities beyond traditional conformation showing for Great Dane owners

## Learning by Doing

Karen served as Show Chair for the 2023-2024 year, I served as her co-chair, and we learned a ton about what it takes to put on a successful event. As Karen told The Vedette newspaper, "The best part of the event is the satisfaction of working with others that care deeply about the interests of Great Danes in a way that promotes the breed."

The following year, I served as Show Chair, while Karen served as co-chair. Our club dedicated the 2025 show to Jim Novotny's memory—a longtime member who exemplified the "Spirit of Illini" through mentorship and selfless service. Jim, a longtime Will County resident and 16-year member, served as board member, vice president, and president. He and his wife Pam received both the People's Choice Award and the prestigious Spirit of Illini Award. Through the years, Jim mentored many members and gave tremendous time and energy to the club's success. That spirit of mentorship and selfless service is what makes this community special.

What we love about these shows is how they bring the community together. Local choirs perform the national anthem, high school students volunteer, and everyone gets to see what responsible dog ownership and breed preservation look like in action. These aren't just dog shows—they're celebrations of community.

## What This Means for Your Family

For families considering a Great Dane, this story matters because it shows what you're really choosing when you select a responsible breeder. You're not just getting a puppy—you're joining a community with deep roots, ongoing education, and genuine care for every dog's future.

When you choose a Great Dane from breeders who embrace this philosophy, you're not just getting excellent bloodlines. You're joining a network of mentorship, education, and support that spans generations. Our commitment to the Illini Great Dane Club's educational mission means we're always learning, always improving, and always available to help your Great Dane thrive throughout their life.

This is what "more than show and go" looks like in practice: breeders who view their role as lifelong stewards rather than simply producing puppies, and who are actively involved in advancing Great Dane health, education, and welfare through meaningful community service.

## Understanding the Great Dane Heart

As Karen beautifully expressed, "Great Danes are honest and true. Unlike other breeds, they can't hide behind a long coat or flashy attitude." This honesty in the show ring reflects a deeper truth about the breed's character.

What truly makes Great Danes remarkable companions is their temperament despite their giant size, their unwavering loyalty to their families, and their nature that has earned them the title "gentle giants." The relationship between humans and dogs spans 20,000-40,000 years, and Great Danes exemplify the qualities that have made this partnership endure: genuine devotion, protective instincts, and an intuitive understanding of their human families' needs.

The Illini Great Dane Club represents the modern expression of this bond: a community understanding that preserving our breed requires education, mentorship, and unwavering commitment to every Great Dane's welfare.

## Honored to Be Stewards

When families choose a Great Dane from breeders who embrace this philosophy, they become part of something larger than a breeding program—they join a legacy that has valued education and relationships for over four decades, all within a community guided by mentors who represent the pinnacle of American Great Dane breeding excellence.

The Illini Great Dane Club is exceptional. The progression from new members in 2022 to our current leadership roles represents the club's remarkable ability to nurture growth while staying true to its founding values: promoting the quality of the purebred Great Dane, protecting and advancing the breed's interests, and encouraging good sportsmanship in competition.

Our service roles—from show leadership to education programming—aren't achievements but opportunities to honor those who came before us while building bridges for those who will follow. We're committed to ensuring that the vision of being "more than show and go" continues to thrive for future generations of Great Dane enthusiasts and responsible breeders.

## Blog Post 2: "Laying the Foundation: Science, Mentorship, and Our First 7Sisters Litters"
**Date:** 2025-06-24

When families ask us how we can predict what their puppy will be like as an adult, the answer lies in understanding genetics and pedigrees. Unlike random breeding, our approach uses proven bloodlines and careful analysis to give families the gentle giant of which they're dreaming.

Our breeding program is the result of mentorship from some of America's most accomplished Great Dane breeders, combined with a scientific approach to genetics that prioritizes predictable temperament, health, and structure for family companions.

## Our Foundation and Mentorship

### Our Mentorship Chain

Both of our first litters involved our mentors and co-breeders Francisco Camacho (Frankie) and Jason L. Dubman (Jaye), who earned the 2023 GDCA Breeder of the Year award with twelve champions, including our foundation bitch Piper. This mentorship chain extends to Karen Martin, the first AKC Advanced Recognition Breeder of Merit to reach Platinum status for Great Danes—one of only two breeders, along with Georgia A. Hymmen, to achieve this milestone.

Karen Martin was the 2022 GDCA Breeder of the Year with eleven champions and continues to provide guidance to all of us. She was the first breeder outside our household to personally evaluate both of Piper's first two litters, showing the collaborative spirit that defines responsible Great Dane breeding.

We're also deeply grateful to our stud dog owners Jessica Lanae Powers and Mara Reyes for allowing us to use their exceptional studs and providing invaluable information about their dogs. This collaborative approach ensures the best possible matches for our breeding program while building lasting relationships within the Great Dane community.

## Our Great Dane Family

### Foundation Dogs

**Our Foundation Dogs**

- **CH Legado N Danekraaft's How Can I Tell You? (Piper):** Our first champion, from a Broadway-themed litter (hence "Pied Piper")
- **7Sisters N Legado's I Wanna Dance, I Wanna Win (Mia):** Piper's daughter, earned her first Major win in 2025
- **7Sisters N Legado's Heart of Gold (Cora):** Made her debut at 7 months in the 2025 Illini GDC show

Each dog represents 35+ generations of careful breeding, connecting today's families to bloodlines dating to the 1870s.

## Progressive Breeding Strategy

### Breeding Terms & Our Two-Litter Approach

**Breeding Terms Simplified**

- **COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding):** 0-6% is considered outcrossing, 6-10% is moderate linebreeding, 10%+ is close linebreeding  
- **ALC (Ancestor Loss Coefficient):** Higher percentages indicate more genetic diversity  
- **Linebreeding:** Breeding related dogs to strengthen specific traits  
- **Outcrossing:** Breeding unrelated dogs to increase genetic diversity  

**First Litter (Rolex x Piper):**  
- Sire: BISS Am GChS Fendanesylcrest N Diriso's This Is the Right Time "Rolex" (COI: 2.3%), bred by Gloria Batchelor, Kathleen Fennell, and Elizabeth Barnhart, and owned by Jose M Diaz  
- Dam: Ch Legado N Danekraaft's How Can I Tell You? "Piper" (COI: 0.0%)  
- Resulting Litter COI: 6.2%  
- **Strategy:** Moderate linebreeding on proven bloodlines

**Second Litter (Sean x Piper):**  
- Sire: Ch Legado N IZYA's Oops! I Did It Again "Sean" (COI: 22.7%)  
- Dam: Ch Legado N Danekraaft's How Can I Tell You? "Piper" (COI: 0.0%)  
- Resulting Litter COI: 12.5%  
- **Strategy:** Increasing linebreeding to concentrate exceptional traits

**Why Two Different Strategies?**

- **First Litter - Testing the Waters:**  
  Our initial breeding with Rolex was a moderate approach, allowing us to see how Piper's excellent outcross genetics (0.0% COI) would blend with proven show bloodlines. The 6.2% resulting COI gave us predictable temperaments and structure while maintaining genetic diversity.

- **Second Litter - Concentrating Excellence:**  
  For our second litter, we chose a more intensive approach. Sean carries a concentrated dose of the same exceptional bloodlines, particularly:
  - Am Ch PRF Fendane Have I Gone Mad (Piper's own father)
  - Am GCh Danemark's Diamond Cartier V Aldawn (appears multiple times)
  - The same Tequila Mockingbird and Allie-Gator lines

**Note:** COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding) values mentioned in this post are calculated from pedigrees and serve as a proxy for true genetic COI. Actual genetic diversity can only be determined through DNA testing, so pedigree-based COI should be interpreted as an estimate rather than an absolute measure.

## The Science Behind Our Strategy

### Detailed Breeding Analysis

**Compounding Excellence: Shared Key Ancestors Between Both Litters**

- Am Ch Saul's Tequila Mockingbird
- Am GCh Fendanesylcrests See You Later Allie-Gator
- Am Ch PRF Fendane Have I Gone Mad (Piper's father + in both sires)

What this means:

Both litters are getting these same influential dogs from both parents.
We're essentially linebreeding on the same key ancestors in both litters.
The second litter intensifies these influences because Sean himself is more linebred on these same lines.

The pattern shows: Heavy reliance on Fendane/Fendanesylcrest bloodlines across our entire breeding program. While this can fix type and create consistency, it also explains why both litters have elevated COI despite our foundation bitch starting with 0.0%.
This is evidence of our breeding decisions: following a specific linebreeding strategy focused on these particular bloodlines, demonstrating the kind of careful genetic planning that responsible breeding requires.

### How COI is Calculated: A Real Example Using Sean

**Understanding Coefficient of Inbreeding Through Sean's Pedigree**

The coefficient of inbreeding (COI) quantifies the likelihood that an individual inherits two copies of the same region of DNA from a common ancestor. Odds are you are not one to break out equations to explicilty explain things, but calculating a COI from a pedigree is a right of passage for all dog nerds. In real life, nearly everyone uses software to make these calculations, but in case the power goes out or your internet fails, it is a good idea to at least have went through this exercise so we can rebuild knowledge if civilization ends, ha! Let's use our own Sean (22.7% COI) as a concrete example of how this calculation works.

**Step-by-Step COI Calculation:**

**1. Identify Common Ancestors**
Sean's COI comes from multiple dogs appearing on both his mother's and father's sides. Let's trace one example:

**Am GCh Danemark's Diamond Cartier V Aldawn** appears twice in Sean's pedigree:
- **Father's side:** Cartier is Sean's paternal grandfather (2 generations back)
- **Mother's side:** Cartier appears as a maternal great-grandfather (3 generations back)

**2. Calculate the Probability**
Using the formula: f = (1/2)^(n1 + n2 + 1) × (1 + F(A))

Where:
- n1 = 2 (generations from father's side to Cartier)
- n2 = 3 (generations from mother's side to Cartier)
- F(A) = 0.0% (Cartier's own COI)

**3. The Math**
f = (1/2)^(2 + 3 + 1) × (1 + 0.0)
f = (1/2)^6 × 1
f = 1/64 = **1.56%**

**4. Why Sean's Total COI is 22.7%**
This 1.56% represents just **one** common ancestor! Sean's COI comes from **multiple** shared ancestors:
- Cartier appears through different paths
- **NORDCH Diplomatic's Umberto di Visconti** appears multiple times
- Several other Danemark dogs appear repeatedly

The 22.7% total represents the sum of ALL these individual contributions.

**5. What This Means for Breeding**
When we bred Sean to Piper (0.0% COI), we were using Sean's genetics from proven bloodlines while relying on Piper's outcross genetics to balance the linebreeding. This strategic approach gave us the 12.5% COI in their puppies—concentrated enough to predict type and temperament, but moderated by Piper's (and Sean's) genetic diversity.

**Important Note:** Pedigree-based COI calculations assume founder dogs are unrelated and serve as estimates. Genetic COI through DNA testing provides more accurate assessments by accounting for some of the actual genetic recombination.

## Champion Bloodlines and Achievements

### Understanding AKC Titles and Abbreviations

**Decoding the Letters: What Those Title Abbreviations Mean**

When reading pedigrees, you'll see many abbreviated titles before and after a dog's name. These represent significant achievements in conformation showing, performance events, and breeding programs. Here's what the most common ones mean:

**Conformation (Dog Show) Titles:**
- **Ch (Champion):** Won 15 points including 2 majors under 3 different judges
- **GCh (Grand Champion):** Earned 25 additional points after becoming a Champion
- **GChS (Grand Champion Silver):** 100 additional Grand Champion points
- **GChG (Grand Champion Gold):** 200 additional Grand Champion points  
- **GChP (Grand Champion Platinum):** 400 additional Grand Champion points
- **BISS (Best in Specialty Show):** Won Best in Show at a breed specialty
- **MBISS (Multiple Best in Specialty Show):** Won multiple specialty shows

**Breeding Recognition:**
- **ROM (Register of Merit):** Produced a specified number of Champions
- **HOF (Hall of Fame):** Exceptional lifetime breeding achievement
- **AOM (Award of Merit):** Top-placing dog at a specialty show

**Performance and Training Titles:**
- **CD (Companion Dog):** Basic obedience title
- **TD (Tracking Dog):** Successfully completed a tracking test
- **RN (Rally Novice):** Entry-level rally obedience
- **BN (Beginner Novice):** Pre-novice obedience level
- **CGCA/CGCU (Canine Good Citizen Advanced/Urban):** Public manners certifications

**International Titles:**
- **NORDCH (Nordic Champion):** Scandinavian championship
- **SUCH (Swedish Champion):** Swedish national championship
- **DKCh (Danish Champion):** Danish national championship

**Placement Indicators:**
- **Am (American):** Distinguishes from international titles
- **Can (Canadian):** Canadian Kennel Club title
- **Int (International):** International championship

**Reading Order:** Titles before the name are typically conformation achievements, while titles after the name are usually performance or specialty recognitions.

These achievements represent years of training, showing, and dedication by owners and handlers, demonstrating excellence in breed type, temperament, and trainability—qualities that benefit families who choose puppies from these accomplished bloodlines.

### Award-Winning Lineage

**Scout: The Winningest Great Dane of All Time**  
Cora and Mia's maternal line through Piper connects to Scout, who stands out across multiple categories when examining Great Dane accomplishments. While excellent dogs have achieved remarkable success in various dog sports, Scout will always be remembered primarily for her extraordinary conformation achievements, which include:
- 93 Group One Placements
- 38 AKC All Breed Best in Shows
- Number One Great Dane across all Systems in 2012 and 2013
- Number 3 Working Dog in 2013
- 254 Best of Breed Wins
- 55,380 dogs defeated, including 5,201 Great Danes

**Champion Sire Lines**  
The paternal lineages are equally impressive. Cora's paternal lineage connects to BISS GCH Izya's Fight On & Fly On "Baron"—an extraordinary dog who earned both the 2022 and 2023 Stud Dog of the Year awards for Great Danes. This exceptional bloodline includes MBISS GCHP Legado N Danemark A Captive Spirit "Marina", winner of both the 2022 Top 20 Great Dane and People's Choice Award at the National GDCA event.

Mia's sire was MBISS GCHS Fendanesylcrest N Diriso's This Is The Right Time "Rolex", bred by Gloria Batchelor, Kathleen Fennell, and Elizabeth Barnhart, and owned by Jose M Diaz and Mara Reyes. A Top 20 finalist in 2022, Rolex received an Award of Merit at the 2022 GDCA National Specialty.

This multi-generational mentorship and award-winning lineage represents 35+ generations of careful breeding, connecting today's families to bloodlines dating to the 1870s.

## Benefits for Pet Families

### Why This Approach Benefits Your Family

**Progressive Breeding Benefits:**
- **Predictable Temperament:** When you choose a 7Sisters puppy, you can expect the gentle, loyal nature that Great Danes are famous for, because we've bred for consistent temperament for generations.
- **Health Advantages:** Our linebreeding on health-tested lines means fewer surprises and more predictable health outcomes.
- **Size and Structure:** You'll know approximately how your puppy will grow and what to expect in terms of exercise, diet, and space requirements.
- **Training Success:** Consistent temperaments mean more predictable training outcomes and easier integration into family life.

**Managing the Risks of Linebreeding**

Our Safeguards:
- Health Testing: All breeding dogs undergo comprehensive, age appropriaate health screening
- Piper's Outcross Advantage: Her 0.0% COI provides genetic diversity to balance the intensive linebreeding
- Careful Selection: We only use this approach when breeding to dogs of exceptional quality like Sean (son of Baron, the 2022 & 2023 Stud Dog of the Year)

**The Results:**
- Mia (from first litter): Earned her first Major win in 2025
- Cora (from second litter): Healthy, typey puppy who made her successful debut at 7 months
- Consistent Family Temperaments: Both litters produce the gentle giants families expect

**What This Strategy Demonstrates**

Both completed litters validated our progressive breeding approach and established the foundation for our future breeding program:
- Predictable adult size
- Consistent temperament: Gentle, loyal, loving family companions
- Health advantages: From health-tested parents and proven bloodlines
- Show potential: Both approaches produced dogs suitable for conformation showing

This progressive strategy demonstrates how decades of careful genetic planning can produce the ideal family Great Dane, and these principles guide our future breeding decisions.

## Our Commitment to Excellence

When families choose a Great Dane from 7Sisters Farm, they become part of something larger than our breeding program—they join a legacy that connects to historic achievements, guided by mentors who represent the pinnacle of American Great Dane breeding excellence, all within a community that has valued education and relationships for many decades.

Our breeding program isn't just about producing beautiful dogs—it's about creating predictable, healthy, well-tempered family companions through science-based decision making and collaboration with the most accomplished breeders in America.

## Blog Post 3: "The Family's Guide to Choosing a Great Dane Breeder: Questions That Matter"
**Date:** 2025-06-25

Finding the right Great Dane breeder isn't just about finding a puppy—you're choosing a lifelong partner in your dog's health, temperament, and future. With so many breeders claiming to be "responsible," how do you identify those who truly prioritize your family's needs and the breed's welfare?

This guide draws from our experience in the Great Dane community and the lessons we've learned about what separates exceptional breeders from the rest. Whether you're a first-time Great Dane owner or adding to your pack, these questions will help you make an informed choice.

**Before You Start:** This guide assumes you've already decided on a Great Dane and understand the breed's basic requirements. If you want to understand what drives us at 7Sisters, start with our post ["More Than Show and Go: Our Journey into the Illini Great Dane Club"](/posts/2025-06-23-more-than-show-and-go) to see how community and relationships shape responsible breeding.

## Before You Start Your Search

The best time to find a breeder is before you're emotionally attached to the idea of "getting a puppy soon." Great breeders often have waiting lists, and the best matches come from thoughtful planning, not impulse decisions. As a breeder, I think of myself as matching families with potential: the potential puppy that will become an amazing dog. It is part of the reason our website is not covered with pictures of cute puppies, but rather healthy, sound dogs that demonstrate our committment to producing excellent dogs.

### Setting Realistic Expectations

**Timeline Reality:**
- Quality breeders typically have 6-18 month waiting lists
- The best breeders often breed only 1-2 litters per year
- Puppy selection usually happens at 6-8 weeks old
- Ideally, plan to visit the breeder in person or at least virtually, before taking your puppy home

**Investment Understanding:**
- Quality Great Dane puppies typically cost $2,000-$4,000+
- Health testing adds significant costs that responsible breeders absorb
- Often, show-quality dogs command premium prices (We have a flat fee because we put the same love and consideration into all of our dogs)
- The most expensive puppy isn't always the best choice for your family

**What You Should Know About Yourself:**
- Your experience level with large dogs (For me, Great Danes fall into exotic animals as much as dogs due to their unique requiremnts)
- Your activity level and exercise commitments
- Your preferences for male vs. female (size differences are significant)
- Whether you're interested in showing, performance events, or just companionship

## Essential Questions for Every Breeder

These questions will quickly separate serious breeders from puppy mills or backyard breeders. Pay attention not just to their answers, but to their enthusiasm for discussing these topics.

### About Their Breeding Program

**The Right Questions to Ask:**

**"Can you explain your breeding philosophy and strategy?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** They should articulate specific goals like temperament, health, or structure improvements. They might mention linebreeding strategies, outcrossing decisions, or working toward breed standards. Quality breeders can discuss their long-term goals spanning multiple generations.

❌ **Red Flag:** "We just breed our pets" or vague answers about "producing healthy puppies" without specifics.

**"Why did you choose this specific pairing?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** They should discuss how the sire and dam complement each other's strengths and offset weaknesses. Quality breeders can explain concepts like coefficient of inbreeding (COI), discuss pedigree analysis, and explain expected outcomes. For deeper insight into this process, see our post ["Laying the Foundation: Science, Mentorship, and Our First 7Sisters Litters"](/posts/2025-06-23-laying-the-foundation) where we detail our progressive breeding strategy.

❌ **Red Flag:** "She was in season" or "We liked both dogs" without deeper genetic planning.

**"Who are your mentors in the breed?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** They should name specific, accomplished breeders who guide their decisions. Quality breeders often co-breed with mentors, attend breed education events, and stay connected to breed clubs.

❌ **Red Flag:** No mentors, or they claim to be entirely self-taught.

**"What health testing do you perform?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** At minimum: cardiac clearance, thyroid testing, and hip evaluation and eye testing. Advanced breeders may discuss genetic testing, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) screening, and breed-specific concerns. They should provide copies of all health clearances.

❌ **Red Flag:** "The vet says they're healthy" without specific testing, or refusal to provide documentation.

### About Their Puppies & Practices

**Understanding Their Puppy Program:**

**"How do you socialize your puppies?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** Detailed socialization protocols starting around 3 weeks, exposure to various sounds/surfaces/people, early neurological stimulation (ENS), and structured puppy curriculum. They should welcome families visiting to help socialize puppies.

**"How do you match puppies to families?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** Temperament testing, lifestyle questionnaires, ongoing communication about family needs, and prioritizing best fit over "first come, first served." Quality breeders often maintain some control over puppy placement.

**"What ongoing support do you provide?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** Lifetime support for questions, willingness to take dogs back if needed, regular check-ins, feeding/training guidance, and connections to other puppy families. Many maintain private Facebook groups for ongoing community.

**"What contracts and guarantees do you offer?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** Written contracts covering health guarantees, spay/neuter requirements for pet puppies, return policies, and clear expectations for both parties. They should explain why contracts protect both families and dogs.

## Red Flags vs. Green Flags

Some warning signs are obvious, but others require knowing what excellent breeders actually do.

### Major Red Flags

⚠️ **Immediate Concerns:**
- **Always has puppies available** - Quality breeding requires careful timing
- **Won't let you visit** - Legitimate breeders welcome visits

- **Continuing education** - Attends seminars, reads research, evolves practices
- **Transparent about challenges** - Honest about breed limitations and difficulties
- **Long-term relationships** - Families who return for second dogs
- **Professional references** - Veterinarians, other breeders, breed experts
- **Detailed puppy records** - Weight charts, vaccination records, early observations
- **Thoughtful breeding frequency** - Limited litters allow focus on quality

✅ **Bonus Points:**
- Co-breeding relationships with established breeders
- Participation in breed health studies or research
- Multiple generations of their own breeding
- Success in various venues (conformation, performance, therapy work)
- Recognition from breed organizations or kennel clubs

## What to Expect During Your Visit

A visit to a quality breeder should feel like meeting potential family members, not shopping for merchandise. Here's what to observe and ask for during your visit.

### Evaluating the Environment

**What You Should See:**

**Clean, Safe Facilities:**
- Dogs should be clean, well-groomed, and healthy-looking

- Opportunity to meet both parents if possible

**Puppy Areas:**
- Clean whelping areas with appropriate temperature control
- Age-appropriate toys and enrichment
- Evidence of early socialization (various surfaces, sounds)
- Puppies should be alert, playful, and healthy-looking

**Questions During Your Visit:**
- "Can you show me the health clearances for both parents?"
- "What does a typical day look like for the puppies?"
- "How do you handle puppy selection and matching?"
- "What happens if this puppy doesn't work out for our family?"
- "Can we meet some families who've gotten puppies from you?"

### Meeting the Parents & Puppies

**Evaluating the Adult Dogs:**

**Temperament Observations:**
- Both parents should demonstrate stable, friendly temperaments
- Dogs should be comfortable with strangers but not overly excited or fearful
- Clear bond between dogs and breeder
- Ask about the dogs' daily routines and activities

**Physical Assessment:**
- Good body condition - neither overweight nor underweight
- Clean ears, bright eyes, healthy coat
- Appropriate size and structure for Great Danes
- Ask to see any titles or achievements

**Puppy Evaluation:**

**Health Indicators:**
- Clean ears and eyes with no discharge

- No signs of illness (coughing, lethargy, diarrhea)

**Temperament Signs:**
- Curiosity about new people
- Appropriate response to handling
- Good interaction with littermates
- Recovery from startle responses

## Understanding Health Testing

Health testing is non-negotiable, but understanding what tests matter and how to interpret results will help you make better decisions.

### Essential Health Clearances for Great Danes

**Required Testing:**

**Cardiac Clearance:**
- Cardiac evaluation by a veterinary cardiologist
- Look for OFA Cardiac clearance or equivalent
- Critical due to Great Dane susceptibility to heart conditions

**Hip Evaluation:**
- OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) certification preferred
- PennHIP evaluation is also acceptable
- Look for "Fair" or better ratings
- Both parents should be evaluated after 24 months of age

**Thyroid Testing:**
- Complete thyroid panel including autoantibodies
- OFA thyroid clearance preferred
- Should be normal or acceptable
- Important for long-term health and temperament

**Eye Clearance:**
- CERF (Canine Eye Registration Foundation) exam
- Performed by veterinary ophthalmologist
- Clear of hereditary eye diseases

**Advanced Testing:**
Progressive breeders may also perform:
- Genetic testing for known mutations
- DCM (Dilated Cardiomyopathy) screening protocols
- Stomach tacking recommendations
- Additional breed-specific testing

### How to Verify Health Testing

**Documentation You Should Receive:**
- Copies of all health clearances for both parents
- OFA certification numbers you can verify online
- Veterinary reports from testing
- Pedigree information showing health testing on ancestors

**Important Note About Missing Documentation:**
If any health testing documentation is missing, there may be valid reasons. Always ask your breeder to explain why something is missing rather than assuming it's a red flag. For example, some breeders work with dogs from other countries that have equivalent but different testing protocols, or they may be working with younger dogs that haven't yet reached the age for certain OFA testing requirements. A responsible breeder will be transparent about why documentation might be missing and what alternative testing or timing applies.

**Red Flags in Health Testing:**

❌ **Warning Signs:**
- Refusal to provide documentation
- "The vet says they're healthy" without specific testing
- Testing performed by non-specialists
- Claims that testing is "unnecessary" for their lines

**Understanding Results:**
Not every dog needs perfect scores, but you should understand:
- How the breeder interprets and uses results
- Why they chose to breed dogs with specific clearances
- What the results mean for your puppy's future health
- Whether both parents complement each other's strengths

## Building the Right Breeder Relationship

The best breeder-family relationships begin before you get your puppy and continue throughout your dog's life. Here's how to foster that partnership.

### What Great Breeders Expect from Families

**During the Selection Process:**
- **Honest communication** about your experience, lifestyle, and expectations
- **Patience with their process** - good matching takes time
- **Willingness to wait** for the right puppy rather than any available puppy
- **Respect for their expertise** in puppy selection and placement
- **Understanding of contracts** and commitment to follow through

**After You Get Your Puppy:**
- **Regular updates** on your dog's development and health
- **Following their feeding and care recommendations** initially
- **Prompt communication** about any health or behavior concerns
- **Honoring contract requirements** for spay/neuter, showing, etc.
- **Maintaining the relationship** beyond just problem-solving

**Long-term Partnership:**
- Sharing your dog's achievements and milestones
- Being willing to help socialize future litters
- Providing references for other potential families
- Contributing to breed health studies if requested
- Considering them for future puppies

### Questions That Show You're a Serious Family

**Questions That Impress Good Breeders:**
- "What feed do you recommend for their first year?"
- "How do you suggest we continue socialization after we bring puppy home?"
- "What early training goals should we focus on?"
- "How often would you like updates on puppy's development?"
- "What would you do if this puppy developed a specific health condition?"
- "Can you explain the coefficient of inbreeding for this litter?"
- "What traits from each parent are you hoping to see in the puppies?"
- "How do you evaluate temperament in young puppies?"

**Demonstrating Your Commitment:**
- Research their breeding program before visiting
- Ask for references from other puppy families
- Discuss your long-term plans for the dog
- Show flexibility in timing for the right match
- Express interest in breed community involvement

## Making Your Final Decision

After visiting breeders and asking the right questions, you'll need to synthesize everything you've learned into a decision that's right for your family.

**Remember:** You're not just choosing a puppy—you're choosing a breeder relationship that may last 8-12 years. The cheapest puppy is rarely the best value, and the most expensive isn't always the best choice for your family's specific needs.

### Evaluating Your Options

**Create Your Comparison Framework:**

**Non-Negotiables:**
- Complete, age appropriate, health testing on both parents
- Willingness to let you visit and meet adult dogs
- Clear contracts and health guarantees
- Lifetime support and willingness to take dog back
- Good reputation in the breed community

**Strong Preferences:**
- Active involvement in breed community
- Mentorship relationships with established breeders
- Detailed socialization and puppy development programs
- Multiple generations of their own breeding
- Good communication style and availability

**Nice to Have:**
- Geographic proximity for easy visits
- Specific color or markings preferences
- Show potential (if that interests you)
- Specific bloodlines or pedigree preferences
- Established puppy families for references

### Red Flags That Should End Your Consideration

**Deal-Breakers:**
- Unwillingness to provide health testing documentation
- Refusal to let you visit or meet the dogs
- No health guarantees or support after purchase
- Pressure tactics or "limited time" offers
- Multiple breeds or constant availability of puppies
- Poor references or reputation in the community
- Unwillingness to take dogs back if needed
- Focus on profit over proper placement

**Subtle Concerns That Should Make You Pause:**
- Reluctance to discuss challenges or limitations
- No involvement in breed education or community
- Vague answers about breeding decisions
- Limited knowledge about pedigrees or genetics
- Poor communication or responsiveness
- Inconsistent information between visits or conversations
