As preservationist breeders, we make complex decisions based on three fundamental pillars: conformation, health, and temperament. All three are essential to producing dogs that fulfill their breed's purpose and thrive as modern companions.

When evaluating conformation, we have more established tools and terminology at our disposal. I can put my hands on a potential stud dog and assess his structural fit for my dams. We have detailed breed standards, standardized terminology, and generations of documented pedigree data. We know what constitutes a conformational fault and would never deliberately double down on structural weaknesses that compromise function or soundness.

Yet when it comes to temperament – equally crucial to breeding decisions – we're working with far less precise tools. We lack standardized assessment methods, consistent terminology, and reliable ways to share behavioral information across breeding programs. This disparity creates a significant gap in our ability to make informed decisions about one of the most important aspects of our dogs.

Interestingly, many of the same limitations we see in temperament assessment tools also apply to health testing. Most health tests provide snapshots in time rather than definitive genetic predictions, and environmental factors like injuries can affect results without representing heritable traits. This suggests that the challenge of meaningful assessment isn't unique to temperament; it's a broader issue in breeding decision-making.

As breeders, we're often asked about temperament. Puppy buyers want to know if their future dog will be good with children, how they'll handle apartment living, or whether they'll excel in specific activities. When we turn to scientific research for temperament assessment guidance, we discover that even the most advanced tools serve clinical and research purposes, not breeding selection.

## The Current Assessment Landscape

Several assessment approaches dominate how we evaluate canine behavior and temperament:

**C-BARQ** represents the gold standard, using 100 validated questions to evaluate 14 behavioral factors plus 22 additional behavioral measures. A shortened version, C-BARQ(S), with 42 questions, was created to be a more convenient tool for assessing behavioral problems in dogs, especially those in shelter environments. Both versions focus on behavioral problems rather than personality traits, using owner reports of how dogs respond to everyday situations. They're scientifically rigorous but designed for clinical and research purposes, not breeding selection.

**Other questionnaires** like the Monash Behavioral Questionnaire and Dog Personality Questionnaire rely heavily on owner interpretation without clear definitions, making results highly subjective and inconsistent between owners.

**Performance titles** demonstrate specific skills under controlled conditions but don't predict general temperament or home suitability.

## Why Existing Tools Fall Short for Breeders

**The Interpretation Problem**
Many assessment tools ask owners to make judgments without providing clear definitions. When the Monash behavioral questionnaire asks about "aggressive" behavior, one owner might consider any barking aggressive while another reserves the term for actual biting. This inconsistency makes data nearly useless for breeding decisions where precision matters.

**They Focus on Problems, Not Potential**
The C-BARQ excels at identifying behavioral issues – separation anxiety, aggression, fearfulness. While valuable for clinical purposes, breeders need to understand the full spectrum of temperament, including positive traits that make dogs wonderful companions. A questionnaire designed to diagnose problems tells us little about breeding for desirable characteristics.

**Performance Doesn't Equal Suitability**
Trial success demonstrates specific skills under controlled conditions, not general temperament or home suitability. These tools measure narrow performance windows, not the broad adaptability that makes a good family companion.

**They Measure Current Reality, Not Genetic Potential**
All these questionnaires assess how individual dogs behave right now, in their current environments, with their current owners. Breeding decisions require understanding which traits are heritable and how they might express across different contexts and generations.

**They Don't Account for "Fit"**
A dog that scores high for "excitability" might be problematic for an elderly owner but perfect for an active family. Current tools measure traits in isolation, without helping match genetic potential to appropriate homes or lifestyles.

**They're Backwards-Looking**
Most assessment tools evaluate adult dogs who've already developed their behavioral patterns through the complex interaction of genetics, early experience, and training. Breeders need to predict how puppies will develop based on parental traits and breeding program goals.

## What These Tools Can Teach Us

Despite their limitations for breeding applications, current research offers valuable insights:

**Behavioral Traits Cluster in Predictable Ways**
The C-BARQ's factor analysis reveals that certain behaviors group together. Dogs high in stranger-directed fear often show nonsocial fear as well. This suggests we should think about temperament as interconnected systems rather than isolated traits – a crucial insight for breeding decisions.

**Owner Perception Shapes Success**
The MDORS research demonstrates that a "good" temperament isn't just about what the dog does – it's about whether the owner finds those behaviors acceptable and manageable. A high-energy dog isn't inherently problematic; they're only problematic if they don't match their owner's lifestyle and expectations.

**Context Shapes Expression**
All assessment tools demonstrate that behavior is highly situational. The same dog might be confident at home but fearful in new environments. This reinforces the critical importance of early socialization and environmental consistency in expressing genetic potential.

**Specific Scenarios Trump General Labels**
The C-BARQ's strength lies in asking about concrete situations: "How does your dog respond when approached by an unfamiliar child while on-leash?" This approach proves far more useful than asking whether a dog is "good with kids" or "friendly" – terms that mean different things to different people.

**Performance Has Narrow Predictive Value**
While obedience titles don't predict home suitability, they do indicate specific capacities: focus, stress tolerance in novel environments, and responsiveness to handler cues. These traits matter for some breeding goals, even if they don't guarantee general temperament quality.

## What Are We Actually Selecting For?

Current research tools often focus on problems to avoid rather than positive traits to cultivate. Key temperament considerations include:

- **Resilience and recovery ability** - bouncing back from negative experiences
- **Biddability and trainability** - genuine interest in working with people  
- **Stable reactivity** - proportional responses to stimuli
- **Appropriate social interest** - friendly but controlled interactions
- **Environmental confidence** - curiosity rather than fear in new situations
- **Impulse control** - ability to wait and settle appropriately
- **Handling tolerance** - accepting necessary care with minimal stress
- **Size-appropriate behavior** - especially crucial for large breeds like Great Danes

No universal "perfect" temperament exists – only temperaments that fit well with their intended roles and families.

## Practical Applications for Breeders

Current research offers immediate guidance for improving our temperament assessment: ask specific questions about concrete situations rather than general traits, observe breeding dogs across varied contexts, and track long-term outcomes with puppy buyers to understand how your lines develop over time.

The research tools show us that better assessment is possible – with clearer definitions, specific scenarios, and standardized terminology. But we're not using these tools to their greatest power because we as individual breeders don't have teams of scientists at our disposal. The real opportunity lies in better data collection, organization, and changing how we think about temperament assessment rather than waiting for new tools.

Scientists are already collecting this data through projects like Darwin's Ark and the Dog Aging Project, but as the Functional Breeding Podcast recently discussed, applying these clinical research tools to practical breeding decisions remains extremely challenging. Even with large-scale data collection, translating research findings into actionable breeding decisions is far more complex than simply having better assessment tools.

## The Great Dane Breeder's Challenge

As Great Dane breeders, we face unique challenges in temperament assessment. Our dogs' size means temperament problems that might be manageable in smaller breeds can become serious safety concerns. A fearful 20-pound dog might hide under furniture; a fearful 140-pound Great Dane might panic and cause injury.

We need temperament assessment tools that account for:
- **Size-appropriate behavior**: How dogs handle their physical presence
- **Breed-specific social roles**: Guardian instincts vs. companion needs
- **Modern living requirements**: Adaptability to urban/suburban environments
- **Safety considerations**: Predictable responses to common situations

The stakes are higher with Great Danes – we're not just breeding for temperament, we're breeding for safe, appropriate behavior in a large, powerful breed that will share homes with families, children, and other pets.

The research discussed in this blog post highlights both the problem and potential solutions. Just as we wouldn't breed two dogs with the same conformational weakness, we shouldn't unknowingly concentrate negative temperament traits that compromise a dog's ability to succeed in their intended role. But without better assessment and communication tools, we risk doing exactly that.

Imagine if we had temperament assessment tools as refined as our conformation evaluation methods. We could systematically identify and select for positive traits while avoiding the concentration of problematic behaviors. We could share detailed, standardized temperament information with the same precision we use for hip scores or genetic test results. Puppy buyers could make informed decisions based on reliable behavioral predictions, not just hopes and general descriptions.

## The Road Forward

The science is catching up to what thoughtful breeders have always known – temperament is complex, heritable, and profoundly important. Current assessment tools offer valuable methodological insights: the importance of specific behavioral description, the need for clear definitions, and the recognition that temperament exists within the context of human-dog relationships.

Responsible breeders have always been geneticists and behaviorists, making complex decisions about temperament with limited tools. We can apply lessons from current research while continuing to develop our own observation skills and breeding judgment.

When Cora hit her adolescent growth spurt at eight months, she was consuming nearly nine cups of food daily and still acting hungry. New Great Dane families often panic at this point—is something wrong? Are they starving their dog? How much is too much?

Yes, Great Danes are dogs, but they’re also exotic pets. If your family grew up with a Miniature Schnauzer or Dachshunds—like me and Karen—you’re in for a rude awakening. They are big dogs. I like to (somewhat jokingly) say that the first rule of Great Danes is: “Protect your knees and teeth!”

The truth about feeding Great Danes challenges everything most people know about dog nutrition. These gentle giants don't just eat more food—they require fundamentally different nutritional strategies that account for their unique growth patterns, metabolism, and long-term health needs.

After multiple litters, conversations with families about feeding challenges, and over 15 years in the breed, we've learned that nutrition confusion causes more anxiety than almost any other aspect of Great Dane ownership. We share this information to help ease the anxiety of both our 7Sisters families and ourselves as breeders. This guide draws from our experience raising champions, mentorship from accomplished breeders, and the latest research in giant breed nutrition to help you navigate every feeding decision with confidence.

<details>
<summary><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></summary>

- Great Danes require nutrition strategies tailored to their unique growth and metabolism—generic dog feeding advice does not apply.
- Controlled, steady growth is essential; overfeeding and rapid growth increase the risk of orthopedic problems.
- Use a Great Dane-appropriate formula with controlled calcium and phosphorus; avoid most generic “puppy” foods.
- Monitor body condition, not just portion size—let your hands, not your eyes, guide feeding adjustments.
- Never free-feed; stick to scheduled, measured meals and adjust as your dog grows.
- Bloat is a serious risk—feed smaller, frequent meals, use slow-feed bowls, and avoid exercise around mealtimes.
- Consult your veterinarian regularly for growth monitoring and diet adjustments.
</details>

## Great Dane Growth and Nutrition: Why Size Changes Everything

Great Danes don't just scale up from smaller dogs—their nutritional needs are qualitatively different. Understanding these differences prevents costly mistakes and sets your dog up for lifelong health.

### Great Dane Puppy Growth Rate: What to Expect

**The Numbers That Matter:**
- Birth weight: 1-2 pounds
- 8 weeks: 15-25 pounds  
- 6 months: 65-90 pounds
- 12 months: 100-140 pounds
- Adult weight: 110-180+ pounds

> For a detailed month-by-month breakdown of what to expect in your puppy’s first year—including milestones, growth spurts, and care tips—see [The First Year: A Month-by-Month Guide to Early Great Dane Development](/posts/2025-07-03-the-first-year).

Your Great Dane puppy will gain approximately **2-4 pounds per week** during peak growth periods. This represents a **9,000% increase** from birth to adult weight for many Great Danes—a growth rate that places enormous demands on developing joints, bones, and organ systems.

**Why This Matters for Feeding:**
- **Controlled growth prevents orthopedic problems** - Fast growth increases hip dysplasia and other developmental issues
- **Nutrient timing is critical** - Missing key nutrients during growth spurts causes permanent problems  
- **Overfeeding is more dangerous than underfeeding** - Excess calories accelerate growth beyond what bones can support
- **Traditional feeding advice doesn't apply** - Recommendations for 30-pound dogs fail catastrophically with giants



### Unique Metabolic Needs of Great Danes

Giant breeds have proportionally **slower metabolisms per pound** than smaller dogs. Piper, who is four at the time of this writing, maintains her adult weight on fewer calories per pound than many other breeds, and this efficiency begins early in puppyhood.

**Key Metabolic Facts:**
- **Lower caloric needs per pound** of body weight compared to smaller breeds
- Different protein requirements throughout growth
- Unique calcium and phosphorus ratios
- Different response to dietary fat

## 7Sisters Farm’s Great Dane Feeding Philosophy

Our approach reflects the experience of our mentors, whose champion dogs demonstrate the results of proper nutrition, combined with guidance from our veterinarians who specialize in giant breed health.

### Core Principles for Feeding Great Dane Puppies and Adults

**1. Controlled Growth Over Maximum Growth**
We never strive for the fastest-growing puppies. Our goal is steady, sustainable growth that supports proper joint development and long-term soundness.

**2. Life Stage Precision**
Feeding requirements change dramatically between 8 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years. Generic "puppy food" doesn't address these transitions.

**3. Individual Monitoring**
Every dog is different. Cora required different feeding strategies than Mia, even though they're half-sisters from similar breeding.

**4. Quality Over Quantity**
Premium nutrition costs more upfront but prevents expensive health problems and supports better development.

**5. Veterinary Partnership**
Regular body condition scoring and growth monitoring with our veterinarian guides feeding adjustments.

## Great Dane Feeding Strategies by Life Stage

<details>
<summary><strong>Newborn to 8 Weeks: Foundation Phase</strong></summary>

**What We Control at 7Sisters:**
During this critical period, puppies receive optimal nutrition through their mother's milk supplemented with high-quality weaning foods starting around 3-4 weeks.

**Our Weaning Protocol:**
- **3-4 weeks:** Introduction of moistened premium food
- **4-5 weeks:** Gradual transition to solid food
- **6-8 weeks:** Independent eating while still nursing occasionally

**What This Means for Families:**
By the time you bring your puppy home, they're already established on a feeding routine that supports healthy growth. We provide detailed transition instructions to maintain this foundation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>8 Weeks to 6 Months: Rapid Growth Phase</strong></summary>

**The Challenge:**
This period requires the most precise nutrition management. Growth is rapid but must be controlled to prevent orthopedic problems.

**Our Recommended Approach:**

**Food Selection:**
- **Great Dane appropriate formula** with controlled calcium (1.0-1.2%) and phosphorus (0.8-1.0%)
- **Moderate protein levels** (24-26%) to support growth without excess
- **Premium brands** with consistent quality and nutritional analysis
- **Avoid "puppy"** formulas that often contain excessive nutrients

**Feeding Schedule:**
- **8-12 weeks:** 4 meals daily, measured portions
- **3-4 months:** 2-3 meals daily
- **4-6 months:** 2 meals daily, increasing portion sizes
- **Free feeding is never appropriate** for Great Danes

**Portion Guidelines:**
In addition to considering feeding charts as guides, we monitor:
- **Body condition scoring** - ribs easily felt but not visible
- **Growth rate** - steady gain without excessive speed
- **Energy levels** - active but not hyperactive
- **Stool quality** - formed, consistent

**Red Flags During This Phase:**
- Visible ribs or hip bones (underfeeding)
- No waist tuck when viewed from above (overfeeding)  
- Excessive panting or lethargy after eating
- Loose stools or inconsistent appetite
- Growth spurts exceeding 5+ pounds per week

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6 Months to 18 Months: Adolescent Phase</strong></summary>

**The Reality:**
This is when families get overwhelmed. Appetites surge, growth continues, but nutritional needs begin shifting toward adult requirements.

**Feeding Transitions:**

**6-12 Months:**
- Monitor for adolescent growth spurts
- Adjust portions based on body condition, not appetite

**12-18 Months:**
- **Slower growth rate** - focus shifts to filling out rather than growing up
- **Portion stabilization** - amounts become more predictable

**Managing Adolescent Appetite:**
Mia went through a phase where she acted starving despite adequate nutrition. This is normal! Great Dane adolescents often have enormous appetites that don't reflect actual nutritional needs.

**Our Strategies:**
- **Measure everything** - everyone needs to know how much they are feeding to properly make adjusements when neceessary
- **Maintain schedule** - consistent meal times prevent food anxiety
- **Monitor body condition** - let your hands guide portions

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>18 Months to Adult: Maturation Phase</strong></summary>

**The Goal:**
Transition to adult maintenance nutrition while supporting final development phases.

**Adult Food Selection:**
- **High-quality adult formula** appropriate for large breeds
- **Moderate protein** (20-24%) for maintenance
- **Controlled fat levels** to prevent excessive weight gain
- **Consider all-natural or limited ingredient** options for dogs with sensitivities

**Portion Management:**
Adult Great Danes typically eat **4-8 cups daily** depending on:
- Individual metabolism
- Activity level
- Spay/neuter status
- Seasonal variations
- Age and health status

**Managing Adult Appetite:**
- **Add small amounts (less than 10% by weight) of low-calorie bulk** - green beans, carrots for satiety without excess calories
- **Monitor weight trends** - adjust portions based on body condition, not begging
- **Consider seasonal needs** - many dogs need more food in winter

</details>

## Choosing the Best Dog Food for Great Danes: Brands, Types, and Quality

### Our Recommended Approach

**What We Feed at 7Sisters:**
We've had excellent results with Purina Pro Plan Large Breed kibble combined with a varied diet of healthy additives and snacks (less than 10% by weight) for both puppies and adults. However, the brand matters less than understanding what to look for in any premium food.

<details>
<summary><strong>Why We Choose Purina Pro Plan for 7Sisters Great Danes</strong></summary>

**The Case for Pro Plan with Great Danes:**

**Research-Backed Nutrition:**
- Purina operates one of the world's largest pet nutrition research facilities
- Conducts actual feeding trials, not just "meets AAFCO standards" formulation
- Long-term studies on large breed development inform their formulations
- Decades of research specifically on giant breed growth and development

**Practical Advantages for Great Dane Families:**
- **Consistent availability** - no supply chain nightmares when you need 50+ pounds monthly
- **Cost-effective** - feeding a 150-pound dog premium boutique food gets expensive fast ($200+/month)
- **Multiple life stage formulas** - smooth transitions within brand as dogs mature
- **Proven track record** - many successful Great Dane breeders have used it for decades

**Great Dane-Specific Benefits:**
- Large Breed formulations with appropriate calcium/phosphorus ratios (1.0-1.2% Ca)
- Controlled protein levels (24-26%) suitable for controlled growth
- Kibble size appropriate for large mouths and proper chewing
- Traditional grain-inclusive formulas (avoiding potential DCM links from grain-free diets)
- Consistent nutrient profiles batch-to-batch

**Addressing Common Concerns:**

**"But what about the ingredients?"**
While Pro Plan contains some ingredients that "food purists" dislike (corn, by-products), these ingredients serve nutritional purposes and are backed by research. Corn provides digestible carbohydrates, and properly processed by-products can be excellent protein sources. We prioritize proven results over marketing claims.

**"Isn't there something better?"**
"Better" depends on your definition. More expensive doesn't always mean more appropriate for your dog. Some boutique brands actually have calcium levels too high for growing giants or use novel proteins that can trigger sensitivities. Pro Plan's extensive research specifically on large breed nutrition makes it a smart choice for Great Danes.

**Our Experience:**
- All our breeding dogs maintain excellent body condition on Pro Plan
- Consistent, healthy coat quality across all our dogs
- Most puppies transition smoothly to new homes on Pro Plan
- Families report easy transitions and satisfied dogs
- Cost allows families to invest in other important areas (training, veterinary care)

**The Bottom Line:**
Pro Plan is scientifically sound, consistently available, and has a proven track record with giant breeds. For our breeding program, it represents a practical, research-backed choice that families can actually afford and access. We prioritize results over marketing, and our dogs' health and condition demonstrate those results.

*Note: Every dog is an individual. While Pro Plan works well for our dogs and most of our puppy families, some dogs may require special diets due to allergies or medical conditions. For example, during certain stages of adolescent development, we’ve found that alternative diets may be more effective for managing or reducing muzzle furunculosis in some of our dogs. Always work with your veterinarian to determine the best nutrition plan for your specific dog.*

</details>

**Quality Indicators:**

To choose the best food for your Great Dane, look for the following quality indicators on the label and from the manufacturer:

<details>
<summary><strong>Key Quality Indicators</strong></summary>

**Label Analysis:**
- **Named meat sources** as first ingredients
- **Calcium between 1.0-1.4%** for puppies, 1.0-1.2% for adults
- **Phosphorus ratios** appropriate to calcium levels  
- **AAFCO feeding trials completed** (not just "formulated to meet")
- **No by-product meals** as primary protein sources

**Manufacturer Standards:**
- **Consistent quality control** - same nutritional analysis batch to batch
- **Research backing** - studies supporting their formulations
- **Veterinary consultation** in formula development
- **Recall history** - transparent communication about any issues

- **Cost considerations** - significantly more expensive for Great Dane portions
- **Use as supplement** rather than primary nutrition

**Raw and Alternative Diets:**
We respect families who choose raw feeding but recommend working with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure complete nutrition during growth phases. The margin for error is smaller with giant breeds.

</details>

**Our Position:**
Premium commercial foods formulated for large breed dogs provide the most reliable nutrition for growing Great Danes. Alternative diets require expertise that most families don't possess.

## Special Feeding Considerations and Common Nutrition Challenges for Great Danes

Below are some of the most important but technical topics in Great Dane nutrition. Expand each section for details relevant to your situation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Bloat Prevention Through Feeding Management</strong></summary>

**The Reality:**
Great Danes have higher bloat risk than most breeds. Feeding management is critical prevention.

**Our Bloat Prevention Protocol:**
- **Elevated feeding stations** to reduce air intake
- **Smaller, frequent meals** rather than large portions
- **Slow-feed bowls** for fast eaters
- **No vigorous exercise immediately before or after meals** - wait 1-2 hours
- **Monitor eating speed** and intervene if necessary
- **Consider prophylactic gastropexy** - discuss with your veterinarian

For an alternative, research-based perspective on bloat risk factors, see [Bloat and the Risk Factors](https://breedingbetterdogs.com/article/bloat-and-risk-factors) by Dr. Carmen Battaglia.

**Warning Signs:**
- Excessive drooling during or after eating
- Restlessness following meals
- Unsuccessful attempts to vomit
- Distended abdomen
- **Bloat is a medical emergency** - immediate veterinary attention required

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Managing Food Allergies and Sensitivities</strong></summary>

**Common Issues:**
- **Environmental vs. food allergies** often confused
- **Protein sensitivities** may develop over time
- **Grain-free concerns** - recent research linking grain-free diets to heart disease

**Our Approach:**
- **Elimination diets** under veterinary supervision
- **Limited ingredient formulas** for suspected sensitivities
- **Avoid frequent food changes** that can create digestive issues
- **Work with specialists** for complex cases

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Growth Plate Considerations</strong></summary>

**The Science:**
Great Dane growth plates don't close until 18-24 months. Nutrition during this period affects lifelong soundness.

**Key Nutritional Factors:**
- **Controlled calcium** - excess accelerates closure and causes problems
- **Appropriate protein** - too little stunts growth, too much accelerates it
- **Balanced minerals** - zinc, copper, manganese for proper development
- **Caloric control** - overfeeding is the biggest risk factor

For a breeder’s perspective and practical checklists on recognizing bone diseases in Great Danes—including HOD, OCD, and Panosteitis—see [A Guide To Recognizing Bone Diseases by Linda Arndt (“Great Dane Lady”)](https://www.greatdanelady.com/articles/guide_to_recognizing_bone_diseases.htm).

**Note:** While this resource offers valuable real-world insights, some recommendations reflect the author’s personal experience and commercial interests, and may not always align with current veterinary consensus or peer-reviewed research. Always consult your veterinarian before making changes to your dog’s diet, supplement regimen, or vaccination schedule. Use this guide as a conversation starter with your vet, not a substitute for professional diagnosis and care.

Watching a Great Dane puppy grow from a 1-2 pound newborn to a 100+ pound adult in just 12 months is one of nature's most remarkable transformations. Understanding what to expect during each stage helps families provide appropriate care, training, and nutrition while recognizing normal development from concerning changes.

This guide draws from our experience raising multiple litters, ongoing mentorship from accomplished breeders, and observations from families who've welcomed 7Sisters puppies into their homes. We'll cover physical development, behavioral milestones, training opportunities, and health considerations for each month of your Great Dane's crucial first year.

<details>
<summary><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></summary>

- Great Dane puppies grow rapidly—expect major changes every month in size, behavior, and needs.
- Growth plates may remain open until 18–24 months; avoid early spay/neuter and excessive exercise.
- Feed for slow, steady growth using large-breed-appropriate feed; overfeeding can cause orthopedic issues.
- Early socialization, training, and veterinary care are critical for a healthy, well-adjusted adult.
- Ongoing support from your breeder and a Dane-experienced vet is essential—don't hesitate to ask questions.

</details>

> **A Note Before You Begin:**  
> There's a wealth of information about Great Danes available online, and many experienced breeders, veterinarians, and experts have written about every aspect of Dane care in far greater detail. My goal here is to provide a practical, organized resource that brings together the basics in one place—so you can find answers quickly and learn a lot fast. Every puppy develops at their own pace, and the timelines in this guide represent typical development, but individual variation is normal. You must always consult a veterinarian who is knowledgeable about Great Danes regarding your specific puppy's growth and health needs, and confirm that your vet understands the unique requirements of this breed. Don't hesitate to seek out multiple sources, ask questions, and use your best judgment. What matters most is finding what works best for your individual dog and family.

<details>
<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: Birth to 2 Weeks (The Neonatal Period)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Birth weight:** 1-2 pounds (450-900 grams).
- **Eyes and ears closed**—puppies rely entirely on touch and smell.
- **Limited mobility**—mostly sleeping and nursing.
- **Umbilical cord detaches** around day 1-3.
- **Daily weight gain:** During the first week, puppies should gain about 10–15% of their birth weight per day. After the first week, steady daily weight gain is still important, but the percentage will gradually decrease as the puppy grows.

**Behavioral Milestones:**
- **Rooting reflex**—automatically seeks mother's milk.
- **Sleep 90% of the time**—only waking to nurse.
- **Temperature regulation**—relies entirely on mother and littermates.
- **Basic reflexes present**—withdrawal from pain, startle response.

**What We Do During This Period:**
At 7Sisters, we perform Early Neurological Stimulation (ENS) from days 3-16, which involves brief, gentle handling exercises designed to produce neurological stimulations that wouldn't occur naturally during this early period. We also begin weighing puppies daily to ensure proper growth rates.

**For Breeders—Critical Care Points:**
- Monitor weight gain religiously—any puppy losing weight needs immediate attention.
- Maintain whelping box temperature at 85-90°F for first week.
- Minimal handling except for health checks and ENS protocols.
- Watch for signs of fading puppy syndrome.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 2-3 Weeks (The Transitional Period)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Eyes begin opening** around day 10-14, fully open by day 21.
- **Ears start opening** around day 13-17.
- **Weight typically doubles** from birth weight.
- **First teeth appear**—baby teeth start erupting.
- **More coordinated movement**—can stand and walk shakily.

**Behavioral Milestones:**
- **First responses to sound** once ears open.
- **Beginning social interaction** with littermates.
- **Startle response** to loud noises develops.
- **Elimination control begins**—can urinate/defecate without mother's stimulation.
- **Tail wagging** starts appearing.

**Early Development Activities:**
- **Gentle handling** to accustom puppies to human touch.
- **Introduction of new textures**—different blankets, surfaces.
- **Soft sounds**—talking, gentle music to begin sound socialization.

**Important Notes:**
This is a critical period for neurological development. We continue ENS until day 16, then begin more varied handling and gentle stimulation. Puppies are still nursing exclusively but beginning to show interest in their environment.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 3-5 Weeks (The Awareness Period)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Weight:** Typically 4-8 pounds by week 4.
- **Coordination improves dramatically**—running and playing begins.
- **Full sight and hearing**—can respond to sights and sounds.
- **Baby teeth fully erupted**—28 temporary teeth.
- **Temperature regulation develops**—less dependent on external warmth.

**Behavioral Milestones:**
- **Play behavior emerges**—wrestling with littermates.
- **Fear responses develop**—can be startled by new experiences.
- **Learning to communicate**—different barks and vocalizations.
- **Curiosity about environment**—investigating new objects.
- **Beginning pack behavior**—hierarchy starts forming in litter.

**Training and Socialization Opportunities:**
- **Early noise exposure**—vacuum cleaners, TV sounds, kitchen noises.
- **Gentle handling**—touching paws, ears, mouth for future grooming.
- **Introduction to different people**—various ages, voices, appearances.
- **Basic surface exposure**—grass, concrete, different textures.

**Feeding Changes:**
Around week 4, we begin introducing gruel (high-quality feed soaked in warm water) alongside continued nursing. Puppies may play in their food more than eat it initially—this is normal exploration behavior.

**What Families Should Know:**
If you're visiting puppies during this period, they're becoming more interactive but still tire easily. Their personalities are just beginning to emerge, and they may show fear responses to new experiences for the first time.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 5-8 Weeks (The Primary Socialization Period)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Weight:** 8-15 pounds by week 6, 12-20 pounds by week 8.
- **Rapid growth phase begins**—dramatic size increases weekly.
- **Motor skills refined**—coordinated running, jumping, playing.
- **Eyes change color**—from blue to adult color for most puppies.
- **Muscle coordination improves**—better balance and agility.

**Behavioral Milestones:**
- **Peak learning period**—easiest time to introduce new experiences; puppies are highly receptive to new sights, sounds, and people.
- **Bite inhibition learned** from littermates and mother—puppies learn to control the strength of their bite through play.
- **House training awareness**—can begin to understand clean/dirty areas, especially with consistent routines.
- **Attention span increases**—can focus on activities for longer periods, making short training sessions more effective.
- **Attachment behavior**—beginning to bond with specific people; puppies may show preference for certain family members.

**Critical Socialization Windows:**
- **Human handling**—expose puppies to different family members, including gentle children, to build trust and confidence.
- **Sound desensitization**—introduce household noises, car sounds, and outdoor environments to reduce future fear responses.
- **Surface variety**—let puppies explore stairs, ramps, and different flooring materials to build confidence and coordination.
- **Other animals**—carefully introduce to cats and older dogs (with vaccinations in mind) to encourage positive interspecies interactions.
- **Basic experiences**—practice collar wearing, gentle restraint, and grooming tools to prepare for future care.

**Training Foundations:**
- **Tonal responses**—puppies respond to familiar voices and tones; use positive reinforcement.
- **Come when called**—practice short distances in safe areas.
- **Sit**—many puppies can learn the basic sit command at this age.
- **Gentle leash introduction**—wearing a collar for short periods and gentle leash handling.

**Feeding and Growth:**
- Puppies are fully weaned by 6-7 weeks and eating solid food 3-4 times daily.
- Feed a high-quality dog food to support proper growth rates.
- Always consult your veterinarian before making major diet changes.
- Rapid growth requires careful nutrition management—too much or too little can cause developmental problems.

**Health Considerations:**
- **First vaccinations** typically start at 6-8 weeks (consult your veterinarian for the best schedule).
- **Parasite screening** and treatment if needed.
- **Growth monitoring**—ensure steady but not excessive weight gain.
- **Joint development**—avoid excessive exercise that could damage growing bones.

**For New Families:**
- Puppies may be ready to go to their new homes around 8 weeks. This is an ideal time for bonding and beginning house training, but remember they have limited bladder control and need frequent potty breaks.
- This is a critical window for socialization—expose your puppy to as many positive experiences as possible, always prioritizing safety and gentle handling.

<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 8-12 Weeks (Leaving Home and Adjustment)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Weight:** 20-35 pounds by week 12.
- **Growth rate:** Gaining 2-5 pounds per week.
- **Adult proportions emerging**—legs getting longer, body stretching.
- **Baby teeth present**—permanent teeth will begin erupting around 3.5 to 4 months.
- **Coordination continues improving**—can navigate stairs with supervision.

**Behavioral Milestones:**
- **Separation anxiety possible**—adjusting to new home without littermates.
- **Bonding intensifies**—puppy may choose primary family members.
- **Confidence building**—exploring new environments with encouragement.
- **Sleep patterns changing**—sleeping through night becomes possible.
- **Attention span improving**—can focus on training for 5-10 minutes.

**Training Priorities:**
- **House training intensive period**—most important skill to establish; expect accidents and be consistent.
- **Basic commands**—sit, stay, come, down.
- **Crate training**—positive association with confined space.
- **Leash walking**—beginning loose leash behavior.
- **Bite inhibition**—redirect puppy biting to appropriate toys.

**Socialization Continues:**
- **Puppy classes**—learning to focus around distractions.
- **Public outings**—hardware stores, pet-friendly businesses.
- **Different environments**—parks, beaches, urban settings.
- **Various people**—children, elderly, people with equipment (wheelchairs, canes).
- **Other animals**—continued exposure to cats, other dog breeds.

**Feeding and Nutrition:**
- Three meals daily of high-quality dog feed formulated specifically for large or giant breeds. Avoid most standard puppy foods, as they are often too high in protein and calcium for Great Danes and can contribute to developmental orthopedic problems. Measure portions carefully—Great Dane puppies should maintain a lean body condition during growth. Overfeeding can also cause developmental issues.
- Always consult your veterinarian before making major diet changes.
- Measure portions carefully—Great Dane puppies should maintain lean body condition during growth.
- Overfeeding can cause developmental orthopedic problems.

**Common Challenges:**
- **Accidents in house**—completely normal, maintain consistency.
- **Destructive chewing**—provide appropriate outlets and redirect.
- **Jumping on people**—begin teaching "four on the floor" immediately.
- **Mouthing/biting**—redirect to toys, never encourage rough play.
- **Sleep disruption**—adjustment period to new schedule and environment.

**Health and Veterinary Care:**
- **Vaccination series**—DHPP, and in the U.S., the first rabies vaccine is usually given at 12-16 weeks (not before 12 weeks).
- **Parasite prevention**—monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention.
- **Growth monitoring**—vet should track weight and development.
- **Spay/neuter discussion**—for giant breeds like Great Danes, discuss with your vet about delaying spay/neuter until after 18-24 months to support healthy growth and joint development.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 6-9 Months (The Adolescent Phase)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Weight:** 70-90 pounds by 9 months
- **Height:** 26-30 inches at the shoulder
- **Sexual maturity**—While some females may have their first heat as early as 9-12 months, most Great Danes experience their first heat between 12-18 months, and some as late as 18-24 months. Males may begin showing interest in females, but full sexual maturity is often later in giant breeds.
- **Growth rate slowing**—still growing but less dramatically
- **Adult coat developing**—texture and color may change

> **Note on Giant Breed Maturity:**
> Great Danes and other giant breeds tend to mature later than smaller dogs. While a Chihuahua might have her first heat at 6-8 months, Great Danes usually take longer to reach sexual maturity. Genetics, nutrition, health status, individual development, and even season can all influence timing. Most families should expect a first heat closer to the dog's first birthday or beyond, but earlier or later is also normal.
>
> **Why this matters:** The timing of sexual maturity affects spay decisions. Many veterinarians now recommend waiting until after the first heat for giant breeds to allow for proper bone and joint development.

**Behavioral Intensity:**
- **Maximum testing phase**—pushing every boundary possible
- **Confidence peaks**—may become overly bold or assertive
- **Attention seeking increases**—dramatic behaviors to get responses
- **Selective memory**—"forgetting" house rules when convenient
- **Peer pressure**—more interested in other dogs than human direction

**Training Persistence:**
- **Don't give up**—this is when many families lose consistency; stick with your training routines
- **Professional help**—consider working with an experienced trainer if challenges arise
- **Group classes valuable**—learning to work around major distractions
- **Practice in new places**—ensuring commands work everywhere, not just at home
- **Emergency recall**—perfecting the come command for safety

**Exercise Requirements:**
- **Significant needs**—under-exercised adolescents are destructive adolescents
- **Mental challenges**—puzzle feeders, training games, exploration
- **Appropriate outlets**—activities that satisfy natural behaviors (chewing, digging, chasing)
- **Supervised freedom**—secured yards or long lines for running
- **Structured activities**—hiking, swimming, organized play

**Social Dynamics:**
- **Dog park caution**—we do not recommended to take adolescent Great Danes to dog parks, as other dogs are unpredictable and the environment can be unsafe for young, developing Danes. Instead, arrange controlled playdates with known, well-mannered dogs for safer socialization.
- **Size awareness**—learning they can't play with small dogs like littermates
- **Human interaction**—may jump, mouth, or otherwise be inappropriate
- **Territorial behavior**—may begin guarding home or family
- **Same-sex conflicts**—particularly intact males may have issues

**Common Crisis Points:**
- **Destructive behavior**—chewing furniture, digging, general mayhem
- **Aggression emergence**—resource guarding, dominance, fear-based reactions
- **Escape attempts**—fence jumping, door dashing, general Houdini behavior
- **House training failures**—marking, accidents, refusing to go outside
- **Excessive vocalization**—barking, howling, demand vocalizations

</details> 

<details>
<summary><strong>Great Dane Puppy Development: 9-12 Months (Maturing Toward Adulthood)</strong></summary>

**Physical Development:**
- **Weight:** 90-120+ pounds by 12 months (varies significantly by sex and lines)
- **Height:** 28-32+ inches at shoulder
- **Near adult size**—80-90% of mature size achieved
- **Sexual maturity complete**—must mitigate risk of premature reproduction (closely supervise intact dogs and discuss timing of spay/neuter with your vet)
- **Growth plates closing**—some may close by 12 months, others continue growing
- Even though your Dane is nearly full size, growth plates may not be fully closed—avoid high-impact activities until your veterinarian confirms it’s safe.

**First Heat Cycle Timing (Females):**
- **Most common:** 12–18 months
- **Early side:** 9–12 months (less common but normal)
- **Later side:** 18–24 months (also normal)

**Behavioral Settling:**
- **Gradual maturation**—testing behaviors begin to decrease

Finding the right Great Dane breeder isn't just about finding a puppy—you're choosing a lifelong partner in your dog's health, temperament, and future. With so many breeders claiming to be "responsible," how do you identify those who truly prioritize your family's needs and the breed's welfare?

This guide draws from our experience in the Great Dane community and the lessons we've learned about what separates exceptional breeders from the rest. Whether you're a first-time Great Dane owner or adding to your pack, these questions will help you make an informed choice.

**Before You Start:** This guide assumes you've already decided on a Great Dane and understand the breed's basic requirements. If you want to understand what drives us at 7Sisters, start with our post ["More Than Show and Go: Our Journey into the Illini Great Dane Club"](/posts/2025-06-23-more-than-show-and-go) to see how community and relationships shape responsible breeding.

<details>
<summary><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></summary>

- Choosing the right breeder is as important as choosing the right puppy—look for transparency, health testing, and mentorship.
- Ask about breeding philosophy, health clearances, socialization, and ongoing support.
- Red flags: always having puppies available, lack of health documentation, unwillingness to let you visit, or no involvement in the breed community.
- Excellent breeders offer lifetime support, clear contracts, and are active in breed education and health studies.
- Use the provided checklists and questions to evaluate breeders and make an informed decision.

## Before You Start Your Search

The best time to find a breeder is before you're emotionally attached to the idea of "getting a puppy soon." Great breeders often have waiting lists, and the best matches come from thoughtful planning, not impulse decisions. As a breeder, I think of myself as matching families with potential: the potential puppy that will become an amazing dog. It is part of the reason our website is not covered with pictures of cute puppies, but rather healthy, sound dogs that demonstrate our committment to producing excellent dogs.

<details>
<summary><strong>Setting Realistic Expectations</strong></summary>

**Timeline Reality:**
- Quality breeders typically have 6-18 month waiting lists
- The best breeders often breed only 1-2 litters per year
- Puppy selection usually happens at 6-8 weeks old
- Ideally, plan to visit the breeder in person or at least virtually, before taking your puppy home

**Investment Understanding:**
- Quality Great Dane puppies typically cost $2,000-$4,000+
- Health testing adds significant costs that responsible breeders absorb
- Often, show-quality dogs command premium prices (We have a flat fee because we put the same love and consideration into all of our dogs)
- The most expensive puppy isn't always the best choice for your family

**What You Should Know About Yourself:**
- Your experience level with large dogs (For me, Great Danes fall into exotic animals as much as dogs due to their unique requiremnts)
- Your activity level and exercise commitments
- Your preferences for male vs. female (size differences are significant)
- Whether you're interested in showing, performance events, or just companionship

## Essential Questions for Every Breeder

These questions will quickly separate serious breeders from puppy mills or backyard breeders. Pay attention not just to their answers, but to their enthusiasm for discussing these topics.

<details>
<summary><strong>About Their Breeding Program</strong></summary>

**The Right Questions to Ask:**

**"Can you explain your breeding philosophy and strategy?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** They should articulate specific goals like temperament, health, or structure improvements. They might mention linebreeding strategies, outcrossing decisions, or working toward breed standards. Quality breeders can discuss their long-term goals spanning multiple generations.

❌ **Red Flag:** "We just breed our pets" or vague answers about "producing healthy puppies" without specifics.

**"Why did you choose this specific pairing?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** They should discuss how the sire and dam complement each other's strengths and offset weaknesses. Quality breeders can explain concepts like coefficient of inbreeding (COI), discuss pedigree analysis, and explain expected outcomes. For deeper insight into this process, see our post ["Laying the Foundation: Science, Mentorship, and Our First 7Sisters Litters"](/posts/2025-06-23-laying-the-foundation) where we detail our progressive breeding strategy.

❌ **Red Flag:** "She was in season" or "We liked both dogs" without deeper genetic planning.

**"Who are your mentors in the breed?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** They should name specific, accomplished breeders who guide their decisions. Quality breeders often co-breed with mentors, attend breed education events, and stay connected to breed clubs.

❌ **Red Flag:** No mentors, or they claim to be entirely self-taught.

**"What health testing do you perform?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** At minimum: cardiac clearance, thyroid testing, and hip evaluation and eye testing. Advanced breeders may discuss genetic testing, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) screening, and breed-specific concerns. They should provide copies of all health clearances.

❌ **Red Flag:** "The vet says they're healthy" without specific testing, or refusal to provide documentation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>About Their Puppies & Practices</strong></summary>

**Understanding Their Puppy Program:**

**"How do you socialize your puppies?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** Detailed socialization protocols starting around 3 weeks, exposure to various sounds/surfaces/people, early neurological stimulation (ENS), and structured puppy curriculum. They should welcome families visiting to help socialize puppies.

**"How do you match puppies to families?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** Temperament testing, lifestyle questionnaires, ongoing communication about family needs, and prioritizing best fit over "first come, first served." Quality breeders often maintain some control over puppy placement.

**"What ongoing support do you provide?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** Lifetime support for questions, willingness to take dogs back if needed, regular check-ins, feeding/training guidance, and connections to other puppy families. Many maintain private Facebook groups for ongoing community.

**"What contracts and guarantees do you offer?"**

✅ **Good Answer:** Written contracts covering health guarantees, spay/neuter requirements for pet puppies, return policies, and clear expectations for both parties. They should explain why contracts protect both families and dogs.

</details>

</details>

## What to Expect During Your Visit

A visit to a quality breeder should feel like meeting potential family members, not shopping for merchandise. Here's what to observe and ask for during your visit.

<details>
<summary><strong>Evaluating the Environment</strong></summary>

**What You Should See:**

**Clean, Safe Facilities:**
- Dogs should be clean, well-groomed, and healthy-looking
- Living areas should be spacious, clean, and well-maintained
- Multiple areas for exercise, play, and rest
- Safe fencing and appropriate housing for the climate

**Happy, Well-Socialized Adult Dogs:**
- Dogs should be friendly and comfortable with strangers
- Clear relationships between dogs and breeder
- Dogs living as family members, not just breeding stock
- Opportunity to meet both parents if possible

**Puppy Areas:**
- Clean whelping areas with appropriate temperature control
- Age-appropriate toys and enrichment
- Evidence of early socialization (various surfaces, sounds)
- Puppies should be alert, playful, and healthy-looking

**Questions During Your Visit:**
- "Can you show me the health clearances for both parents?"
- "What does a typical day look like for the puppies?"
- "How do you handle puppy selection and matching?"
- "What happens if this puppy doesn't work out for our family?"
- "Can we meet some families who've gotten puppies from you?"

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Meeting the Parents & Puppies</strong></summary>

**Evaluating the Adult Dogs:**

**Temperament Observations:**
- Both parents should demonstrate stable, friendly temperaments
- Dogs should be comfortable with strangers but not overly excited or fearful
- Clear bond between dogs and breeder
- Ask about the dogs' daily routines and activities

**Physical Assessment:**
- Good body condition - neither overweight nor underweight
- Clean ears, bright eyes, healthy coat
- Appropriate size and structure for Great Danes
- Ask to see any titles or achievements

**Puppy Evaluation:**

**Health Indicators:**
- Clean ears and eyes with no discharge
- Good body condition and muscle tone
- Active and alert when awake
- No signs of illness (coughing, lethargy, diarrhea)

**Temperament Signs:**
- Curiosity about new people
- Appropriate response to handling
- Good interaction with littermates
- Recovery from startle responses

</details>

## Understanding Health Testing

Health testing is non-negotiable, but understanding what tests matter and how to interpret results will help you make better decisions.

<details>
<summary><strong>Essential Health Clearances for Great Danes</strong></summary>

**Required Testing:**

**Cardiac Clearance:**
- Cardiac evaluation by a veterinary cardiologist
- Look for OFA Cardiac clearance or equivalent
- Critical due to Great Dane susceptibility to heart conditions

**Hip Evaluation:**
- OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) certification preferred
- PennHIP evaluation is also acceptable
- Look for "Fair" or better ratings
- Both parents should be evaluated after 24 months of age

**Thyroid Testing:**
- Complete thyroid panel including autoantibodies
- OFA thyroid clearance preferred
- Should be normal or acceptable
- Important for long-term health and temperament

**Eye Clearance:**
- CERF (Canine Eye Registration Foundation) exam
- Performed by veterinary ophthalmologist
- Clear of hereditary eye diseases

**Advanced Testing:**
Progressive breeders may also perform:
- Genetic testing for known mutations
- DCM (Dilated Cardiomyopathy) screening protocols
- Stomach tacking recommendations
- Additional breed-specific testing

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to Verify Health Testing</strong></summary>

**Documentation You Should Receive:**
- Copies of all health clearances for both parents
- OFA certification numbers you can verify online
- Veterinary reports from testing
- Pedigree information showing health testing on ancestors

**Important Note About Missing Documentation:**
If any health testing documentation is missing, there may be valid reasons. Always ask your breeder to explain why something is missing rather than assuming it's a red flag. For example, some breeders work with dogs from other countries that have equivalent but different testing protocols, or they may be working with younger dogs that haven't yet reached the age for certain OFA testing requirements. A responsible breeder will be transparent about why documentation might be missing and what alternative testing or timing applies.

**Red Flags in Health Testing:**

❌ **Warning Signs:**
- Refusal to provide documentation
- "The vet says they're healthy" without specific testing
- Testing performed by non-specialists
- Claims that testing is "unnecessary" for their lines

**Understanding Results:**
Not every dog needs perfect scores, but you should understand:
- How the breeder interprets and uses results
- Why they chose to breed dogs with specific clearances
- What the results mean for your puppy's future health
- Whether both parents complement each other's strengths

</details>

## Building the Right Breeder Relationship

The best breeder-family relationships begin before you get your puppy and continue throughout your dog's life. Here's how to foster that partnership.

<details>
<summary><strong>What Great Breeders Expect from Families</strong></summary>

**During the Selection Process:**
- **Honest communication** about your experience, lifestyle, and expectations
- **Patience with their process** - good matching takes time
- **Willingness to wait** for the right puppy rather than any available puppy
- **Respect for their expertise** in puppy selection and placement
- **Understanding of contracts** and commitment to follow through

**After You Get Your Puppy:**
- **Regular updates** on your dog's development and health
- **Following their feeding and care recommendations** initially
- **Prompt communication** about any health or behavior concerns
- **Honoring contract requirements** for spay/neuter, showing, etc.
- **Maintaining the relationship** beyond just problem-solving

**Long-term Partnership:**
- Sharing your dog's achievements and milestones
- Being willing to help socialize future litters
- Providing references for other potential families
- Contributing to breed health studies if requested
- Considering them for future puppies

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Questions That Show You're a Serious Family</strong></summary>

**Questions That Impress Good Breeders:**
- "What feed do you recommend for their first year?"
- "How do you suggest we continue socialization after we bring puppy home?"
- "What early training goals should we focus on?"
- "How often would you like updates on puppy's development?"
- "What would you do if this puppy developed a specific health condition?"
- "Can you explain the coefficient of inbreeding for this litter?"
- "What traits from each parent are you hoping to see in the puppies?"
- "How do you evaluate temperament in young puppies?"

**Demonstrating Your Commitment:**
- Research their breeding program before visiting
- Ask for references from other puppy families
- Discuss your long-term plans for the dog
- Show flexibility in timing for the right match
- Express interest in breed community involvement

</details>

## Making Your Final Decision

After visiting breeders and asking the right questions, you'll need to synthesize everything you've learned into a decision that's right for your family.

**Remember:** You're not just choosing a puppy—you're choosing a breeder relationship that may last 8-12 years. The cheapest puppy is rarely the best value, and the most expensive isn't always the best choice for your family's specific needs.

<details>
<summary><strong>Evaluating Your Options</strong></summary>

**Create Your Comparison Framework:**

**Non-Negotiables:**
- Complete, age appropriate, health testing on both parents
- Willingness to let you visit and meet adult dogs
- Clear contracts and health guarantees

- Good communication style and availability

**Nice to Have:**
- Geographic proximity for easy visits
- Specific color or markings preferences
- Show potential (if that interests you)
- Specific bloodlines or pedigree preferences
- Established puppy families for references

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Red Flags That Should End Your Consideration</strong></summary>

**Deal-Breakers:**
- Unwillingness to provide health testing documentation
- Refusal to let you visit or meet the dogs
- No health guarantees or support after purchase
- Pressure tactics or "limited time" offers
- Multiple breeds or constant availability of puppies
- Poor references or reputation in the community
- Unwillingness to take dogs back if needed
- Focus on profit over proper placement

**Subtle Concerns That Should Make You Pause:**
- Reluctance to discuss challenges or limitations
- No involvement in breed education or community
- Vague answers about breeding decisions
- Limited knowledge about pedigrees or genetics
- Poor communication or responsiveness
- Inconsistent information between visits or conversations

</details>

When families ask us how we can predict what their puppy will be like as an adult, the answer lies in understanding genetics and pedigrees. Unlike random breeding, our approach uses proven bloodlines and careful analysis to give families the gentle giant of which they're dreaming.

Our breeding program is the result of mentorship from some of America's most accomplished Great Dane breeders, combined with a scientific approach to genetics that prioritizes predictable temperament, health, and structure for family companions.

<details>
<summary><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></summary>

- Predictable temperament, health, and structure come from careful genetic planning and mentorship.
- The 7Sisters breeding program uses both outcrossing and linebreeding, guided by top mentors in the breed.
- All breeding dogs undergo comprehensive health testing; COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding) is carefully managed.
- Award-winning bloodlines and multi-generational mentorship ensure quality and predictability.
- Families benefit from consistent temperament, health advantages, and ongoing breeder support.

</details>

## Our Foundation and Mentorship

<details>
<summary><strong>Our Mentorship Chain</strong></summary>

Both of our first litters involved our mentors and co-breeders Francisco Camacho (Frankie) and Jason L. Dubman (Jaye), who earned the 2023 GDCA Breeder of the Year award with twelve champions, including our foundation bitch Piper. This mentorship chain extends to Karen Martin, the first AKC Advanced Recognition Breeder of Merit to reach Platinum status for Great Danes—one of only two breeders, along with Georgia A. Hymmen, to achieve this milestone.

Karen Martin was the 2022 GDCA Breeder of the Year with eleven champions and continues to provide guidance to all of us. She was the first breeder outside our household to personally evaluate both of Piper's first two litters, showing the collaborative spirit that defines responsible Great Dane breeding.

We're also deeply grateful to our stud dog owners Jessica Lanae Powers and Mara Reyes for allowing us to use their exceptional studs and providing invaluable information about their dogs. This collaborative approach ensures the best possible matches for our breeding program while building lasting relationships within the Great Dane community.

</details>

## Our Great Dane Family

<details>
<summary><strong>Foundation Dogs</strong></summary>

**Our Foundation Dogs**

- **CH Legado N Danekraaft's How Can I Tell You? (Piper):** Our first champion, from a Broadway-themed litter (hence "Pied Piper")
- **7Sisters N Legado's I Wanna Dance, I Wanna Win (Mia):** Piper's daughter, earned her first Major win in 2025
- **7Sisters N Legado's Heart of Gold (Cora):** Made her debut at 7 months in the 2025 Illini GDC show

Each dog represents 35+ generations of careful breeding, connecting today's families to bloodlines dating to the 1870s.

</details>

## Progressive Breeding Strategy

<details>
<summary><strong>Breeding Terms & Our Two-Litter Approach</strong></summary>

**Breeding Terms Simplified**

- **COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding):** 0-6% is considered outcrossing, 6-10% is moderate linebreeding, 10%+ is close linebreeding  
- **ALC (Ancestor Loss Coefficient):** Higher percentages indicate more genetic diversity  
- **Linebreeding:** Breeding related dogs to strengthen specific traits  
- **Outcrossing:** Breeding unrelated dogs to increase genetic diversity  

**First Litter (Rolex x Piper):**  
- Sire: BISS Am GChS Fendanesylcrest N Diriso's This Is the Right Time "Rolex" (COI: 2.3%), bred by Gloria Batchelor, Kathleen Fennell, and Elizabeth Barnhart, and owned by Jose M Diaz  
- Dam: Ch Legado N Danekraaft's How Can I Tell You? "Piper" (COI: 0.0%)  
- Resulting Litter COI: 6.2%  
- **Strategy:** Moderate linebreeding on proven bloodlines

**Second Litter (Sean x Piper):**  
- Sire: Ch Legado N IZYA's Oops! I Did It Again "Sean" (COI: 22.7%)  
- Dam: Ch Legado N Danekraaft's How Can I Tell You? "Piper" (COI: 0.0%)  
- Resulting Litter COI: 12.5%  
- **Strategy:** Increasing linebreeding to concentrate exceptional traits

**Why Two Different Strategies?**

- **First Litter - Testing the Waters:**  
  Our initial breeding with Rolex was a moderate approach, allowing us to see how Piper's excellent outcross genetics (0.0% COI) would blend with proven show bloodlines. The 6.2% resulting COI gave us predictable temperaments and structure while maintaining genetic diversity.

- **Second Litter - Concentrating Excellence:**  
  For our second litter, we chose a more intensive approach. Sean carries a concentrated dose of the same exceptional bloodlines, particularly:
  - Am Ch PRF Fendane Have I Gone Mad (Piper's own father)
  - Am GCh Danemark's Diamond Cartier V Aldawn (appears multiple times)
  - The same Tequila Mockingbird and Allie-Gator lines

**Note:** COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding) values mentioned in this post are calculated from pedigrees and serve as a proxy for true genetic COI. Actual genetic diversity can only be determined through DNA testing, so pedigree-based COI should be interpreted as an estimate rather than an absolute measure.

</details>

## The Science Behind Our Strategy

<details>
<summary><strong>Detailed Breeding Analysis</strong></summary>

**Compounding Excellence: Shared Key Ancestors Between Both Litters**

- Am Ch Saul's Tequila Mockingbird
- Am GCh Fendanesylcrests See You Later Allie-Gator
- Am Ch PRF Fendane Have I Gone Mad (Piper's father + in both sires)

What this means:

Both litters are getting these same influential dogs from both parents.
We're essentially linebreeding on the same key ancestors in both litters.
The second litter intensifies these influences because Sean himself is more linebred on these same lines.

The pattern shows: Heavy reliance on Fendane/Fendanesylcrest bloodlines across our entire breeding program. While this can fix type and create consistency, it also explains why both litters have elevated COI despite our foundation bitch starting with 0.0%.
This is evidence of our breeding decisions: following a specific linebreeding strategy focused on these particular bloodlines, demonstrating the kind of careful genetic planning that responsible breeding requires.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How COI is Calculated: A Real Example Using Sean</strong></summary>

**Understanding Coefficient of Inbreeding Through Sean's Pedigree**

The coefficient of inbreeding (COI) quantifies the likelihood that an individual inherits two copies of the same region of DNA from a common ancestor. Odds are you are not one to break out equations to explicilty explain things, but calculating a COI from a pedigree is a right of passage for all dog nerds. In real life, nearly everyone uses software to make these calculations, but in case the power goes out or your internet fails, it is a good idea to at least have went through this exercise so we can rebuild knowledge if civilization ends, ha! Let's use our own Sean (22.7% COI) as a concrete example of how this calculation works.

**Step-by-Step COI Calculation:**

**1. Identify Common Ancestors**
Sean's COI comes from multiple dogs appearing on both his mother's and father's sides. Let's trace one example:

**Am GCh Danemark's Diamond Cartier V Aldawn** appears twice in Sean's pedigree:
- **Father's side:** Cartier is Sean's paternal grandfather (2 generations back)
- **Mother's side:** Cartier appears as a maternal great-grandfather (3 generations back)

**2. Calculate the Probability**
Using the formula: f = (1/2)^(n1 + n2 + 1) × (1 + F(A))

Where:
- n1 = 2 (generations from father's side to Cartier)
- n2 = 3 (generations from mother's side to Cartier)
- F(A) = 0.0% (Cartier's own COI)

**3. The Math**
f = (1/2)^(2 + 3 + 1) × (1 + 0.0)
f = (1/2)^6 × 1
f = 1/64 = **1.56%**

**4. Why Sean's Total COI is 22.7%**
This 1.56% represents just **one** common ancestor! Sean's COI comes from **multiple** shared ancestors:
- Cartier appears through different paths
- **NORDCH Diplomatic's Umberto di Visconti** appears multiple times
- Several other Danemark dogs appear repeatedly

The 22.7% total represents the sum of ALL these individual contributions.

**5. What This Means for Breeding**
When we bred Sean to Piper (0.0% COI), we were using Sean's genetics from proven bloodlines while relying on Piper's outcross genetics to balance the linebreeding. This strategic approach gave us the 12.5% COI in their puppies—concentrated enough to predict type and temperament, but moderated by Piper's (and Sean's) genetic diversity.

**Important Note:** Pedigree-based COI calculations assume founder dogs are unrelated and serve as estimates. Genetic COI through DNA testing provides more accurate assessments by accounting for some of the actual genetic recombination.

## Champion Bloodlines and Achievements

<details>
<summary><strong>Understanding AKC Titles and Abbreviations</strong></summary>

**Decoding the Letters: What Those Title Abbreviations Mean**

When reading pedigrees, you'll see many abbreviated titles before and after a dog's name. These represent significant achievements in conformation showing, performance events, and breeding programs. Here's what the most common ones mean:

**Conformation (Dog Show) Titles:**
- **Ch (Champion):** Won 15 points including 2 majors under 3 different judges
- **GCh (Grand Champion):** Earned 25 additional points after becoming a Champion
- **GChS (Grand Champion Silver):** 100 additional Grand Champion points
- **GChG (Grand Champion Gold):** 200 additional Grand Champion points  
- **GChP (Grand Champion Platinum):** 400 additional Grand Champion points
- **BISS (Best in Specialty Show):** Won Best in Show at a breed specialty
- **MBISS (Multiple Best in Specialty Show):** Won multiple specialty shows

**Breeding Recognition:**
- **ROM (Register of Merit):** Produced a specified number of Champions
- **HOF (Hall of Fame):** Exceptional lifetime breeding achievement
- **AOM (Award of Merit):** Top-placing dog at a specialty show

**Performance and Training Titles:**
- **CD (Companion Dog):** Basic obedience title
- **TD (Tracking Dog):** Successfully completed a tracking test
- **RN (Rally Novice):** Entry-level rally obedience
- **BN (Beginner Novice):** Pre-novice obedience level
- **CGCA/CGCU (Canine Good Citizen Advanced/Urban):** Public manners certifications

**International Titles:**
- **NORDCH (Nordic Champion):** Scandinavian championship
- **SUCH (Swedish Champion):** Swedish national championship
- **DKCh (Danish Champion):** Danish national championship

**Placement Indicators:**
- **Am (American):** Distinguishes from international titles
- **Can (Canadian):** Canadian Kennel Club title
- **Int (International):** International championship

**Reading Order:** Titles before the name are typically conformation achievements, while titles after the name are usually performance or specialty recognitions.

These achievements represent years of training, showing, and dedication by owners and handlers, demonstrating excellence in breed type, temperament, and trainability—qualities that benefit families throughout [early puppy development](/posts/2025-07-03-the-first-year).

<details>
<summary><strong>Award-Winning Lineage</strong></summary>

**Scout: The Winningest Great Dane of All Time**  
Cora and Mia's maternal line through Piper connects to Scout, who stands out across multiple categories when examining Great Dane accomplishments. While excellent dogs have achieved remarkable success in various dog sports, Scout will always be remembered primarily for her extraordinary conformation achievements, which include:
- 93 Group One Placements
- 38 AKC All Breed Best in Shows
- Number One Great Dane across all Systems in 2012 and 2013
- Number 3 Working Dog in 2013
- 254 Best of Breed Wins
- 55,380 dogs defeated, including 5,201 Great Danes

**Champion Sire Lines**  
The paternal lineages are equally impressive. Cora's paternal lineage connects to BISS GCH Izya's Fight On & Fly On "Baron"—an extraordinary dog who earned both the 2022 and 2023 Stud Dog of the Year awards for Great Danes. This exceptional bloodline includes MBISS GCHP Legado N Danemark A Captive Spirit "Marina", winner of both the 2022 Top 20 Great Dane and People's Choice Award at the National GDCA event.

Mia's sire was MBISS GCHS Fendanesylcrest N Diriso's This Is The Right Time "Rolex", bred by Gloria Batchelor, Kathleen Fennell, and Elizabeth Barnhart, and owned by Jose M Diaz and Mara Reyes. A Top 20 finalist in 2022, Rolex received an Award of Merit at the 2022 GDCA National Specialty.

This multi-generational mentorship and award-winning lineage represents 35+ generations of careful breeding, connecting today's families to bloodlines dating to the 1870s.

## Benefits for Pet Families

<details>
<summary><strong>Why This Approach Benefits Your Family</strong></summary>

**Progressive Breeding Benefits:**
- **Predictable Temperament:** When you choose a 7Sisters puppy, you can expect the gentle, loyal nature that Great Danes are famous for, because we've bred for consistent temperament for generations.
- **Health Advantages:** Our linebreeding on health-tested lines means fewer surprises and more predictable health outcomes.
- **Size and Structure:** You'll know approximately how your puppy will grow and what to expect in terms of exercise, diet, and space requirements.
- **Training Success:** Consistent temperaments mean more predictable training outcomes and easier integration into family life.

**Managing the Risks of Linebreeding**

Our Safeguards:
- Health Testing: All breeding dogs undergo comprehensive, age appropriaate health screening
- Piper's Outcross Advantage: Her 0.0% COI provides genetic diversity to balance the intensive linebreeding
- Careful Selection: We only use this approach when breeding to dogs of exceptional quality like Sean (son of Baron, the 2022 & 2023 Stud Dog of the Year)

**The Results:**
- Mia (from first litter): Earned her first Major win in 2025
- Cora (from second litter): Healthy, typey puppy who made her successful debut at 7 months
- Consistent Family Temperaments: Both litters produce the gentle giants families expect

**What This Strategy Demonstrates**

Both completed litters validated our progressive breeding approach and established the foundation for our future breeding program:
- Predictable adult size
- Consistent temperament: Gentle, loyal, loving family companions
- Health advantages: From health-tested parents and proven bloodlines
- Show potential: Both approaches produced dogs suitable for conformation showing

This progressive strategy demonstrates how decades of careful genetic planning can produce the ideal family Great Dane, and these principles guide our future breeding decisions.

When Pat Lawrence gathered friends around her kitchen table in 1982, she may have had no idea her vision would still be shaping Great Dane breeders four decades later. She dreamed of a "different kind of club"—one that offered education, community, and genuine relationships rather than just competition.
Three years ago in 2022, my spouse Karen and I walked into our first Illini Great Dane Club meeting as curious newcomers. Today, we're deeply involved in a community that's taught us what responsible breeding and genuine mentorship look like. Here's our story of discovering what "more than show and go" really means, and why it matters for every family considering a Great Dane.

<details>
<summary><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></summary>

- The Illini Great Dane Club is built on education, mentorship, and community—not just competition.
- Responsible breeders are deeply involved in ongoing learning and service, not just producing puppies.
- Choosing a Great Dane from a breeder with this philosophy means joining a supportive, knowledgeable community.

## What We've Learned About Community

The Illini Great Dane Club isn't just about showing dogs—it's about building relationships and learning together. When we first joined, we were amazed by how much education and mentorship happens here. The club's founder, Pat Lawrence, wanted something different from the typical "show and go" mentality, and that spirit is still alive today.

As charter member Jeff Lawrence recalled, "Mom wanted them to have fun and to learn something also." That's exactly what we've experienced. From flea markets in borrowed buildings to entertaining skits that poked fun at different types of handlers and judges, the founding members understood that preserving the breed required more than passion—it needed community, education, and real commitment.

## Education in Action

As Public & Club Education Chair, I've made it part of my mission to host programs that actually help people. We're not just talking theory—we're tackling real challenges that Great Dane breeders and owners face today.

<details>
<summary><strong>Educational Programs</strong></summary>

</details>

## Learning by Doing

Karen served as Show Chair for the 2023-2024 year, I served as her co-chair, and we learned a ton about what it takes to put on a successful event. As Karen told The Vedette newspaper, "The best part of the event is the satisfaction of working with others that care deeply about the interests of Great Danes in a way that promotes the breed."

The following year, I served as Show Chair, while Karen served as co-chair. Our club dedicated the 2025 show to Jim Novotny's memory—a longtime member who exemplified the "Spirit of Illini" through mentorship and selfless service. Jim, a longtime Will County resident and 16-year member, served as board member, vice president, and president. He and his wife Pam received both the People's Choice Award and the prestigious Spirit of Illini Award. Through the years, Jim mentored many members and gave tremendous time and energy to the club's success. That spirit of mentorship and selfless service is what makes this community special.

What we love about these shows is how they bring the community together. Local choirs perform the national anthem, high school students volunteer, and everyone gets to see what responsible dog ownership and breed preservation look like in action. These aren't just dog shows—they're celebrations of community.


## What This Means for Your Family

For families considering a Great Dane, this story matters because it shows what you're really choosing when you select a responsible breeder. You're not just getting a puppy—you're joining a community with deep roots, ongoing education, and genuine care for every dog's future.

When you choose a Great Dane from breeders who embrace this philosophy, you're not just getting excellent bloodlines. You're joining a network of mentorship, education, and support that spans generations. Our commitment to the Illini Great Dane Club's educational mission means we're always learning, always improving, and always available to help your Great Dane thrive throughout their life.

This is what "more than show and go" looks like in practice: breeders who view their role as lifelong stewards rather than simply producing puppies, and who are actively involved in advancing Great Dane health, education, and welfare through meaningful community service.

## Understanding the Great Dane Heart

As Karen beautifully expressed, "Great Danes are honest and true. Unlike other breeds, they can't hide behind a long coat or flashy attitude." This honesty in the show ring reflects a deeper truth about the breed's character.

What truly makes Great Danes remarkable companions is their temperament despite their giant size, their unwavering loyalty to their families, and their nature that has earned them the title "gentle giants." The relationship between humans and dogs spans 20,000-40,000 years, and Great Danes exemplify the qualities that have made this partnership endure: genuine devotion, protective instincts, and an intuitive understanding of their human families' needs.

The Illini Great Dane Club represents the modern expression of this bond: a community understanding that preserving our breed requires education, mentorship, and unwavering commitment to every Great Dane's welfare.

## Honored to Be Stewards

When families choose a Great Dane from breeders who embrace this philosophy, they become part of something larger than a breeding program—they join a legacy that has valued education and relationships for over four decades, all within a community guided by mentors who represent the pinnacle of American Great Dane breeding excellence.

The Illini Great Dane Club is exceptional. The progression from new members in 2022 to our current leadership roles represents the club's remarkable ability to nurture growth while staying true to its founding values: promoting the quality of the purebred Great Dane, protecting and advancing the breed's interests, and encouraging good sportsmanship in competition.

Our service roles—from show leadership to education programming—aren't achievements but opportunities to honor those who came before us while building bridges for those who will follow. We're committed to ensuring that the vision of being "more than show and go" continues to thrive for future generations of Great Dane enthusiasts and responsible breeders.
